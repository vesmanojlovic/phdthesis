\chapter{Appendix B}

The Appendix B is included in the back matter of the thesis. No \textit{\textbackslash\hspace{-0.5mm}appendix} command is used. This produces that the appendix input in the table of contents is not labelled, neither with arabic numbers nor capital letters. The only text that will appear in the appendix title is that written in the \textit{\textbackslash\hspace{-0.5mm}chapter}$\{\}$ command brackets. In this cases this is 'Appendix B'.
