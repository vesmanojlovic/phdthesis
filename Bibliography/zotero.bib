	abstract = {The Yule model is a frequently-used evolutionary model that can be utilized to generate random genealogical trees. Under this model, using a backwards counting method differing from the approach previously employed by Heard (Evolution 46: 1818-1826), for a genealogical tree of n lineages, the mean number of nodes with exactly r descendants is computed (2 ≤ r ≤ n − 1). The variance of the number of r-pronged nodes is also obtained, as are the mean and variance of the number of r-caterpillars. These results generalize computations of {McKenzie} and Steel for the case of r = 2 (Math. Biosci. 164: 81-92, 2000). For a given n, the two means are largest at r = 2, equaling 2n/3 for n ≥ 5. However, for n ≥ 9, the variances are largest at r = 3, equaling 23n/420 for n ≥ 7. As n → ∞, the fraction of internal nodes that are r-caterpillars for some r approaches (e2 − 5)/4 ≈ 0.59726.},

These models have been used as priors in Bayesian approaches to phylogenetic analysis, and also to test hypotheses concerning the speciation process. In this paper we describe new results for three properties of trees generated under such models. Firstly, for a rooted tree generated by the Yule model we describe the probability distribution on the depth (number of edges from the root) of the most recent common ancestor of a random subset of k species. Next we show that, for trees generated under the Yule model, the approximate position of the root can be estimated from the associated unrooted tree, even for trees with a large number of leaves. Finally, we analyse a biologically motivated extension of the Yule model and describe its distribution on tree shapes when speciation occurs in rapid bursts. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

We focus on inferring the symmetric division probability for cancer stem cells in our model, as this is believed to be a key driving parameter of tumour progression and therapeutic response. Given the advent of multi-region sampling, and the opportunities offered by them to understand tumour evolutionary history, we focus on a suite of statistical measures of the phylogenetic trees resulting from the tumour’s evolution in different regions of parameter space and through time. We ﬁnd strikingly different patterns in these measures for changing symmetric division probability which hinge on the inclusion of spatial constraints. These results give us a starting point to begin stratifying tumours by this biological parameter and also generate a number of actionable clinical and biological hypotheses including changes during therapy, and through tumour evolution.},

	abstract = {Neoplasms change over time through a process of cell-level evolution, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. However, the ecology of the microenvironment of a neoplastic cell determines which changes provide adaptive benefits. There is widespread recognition of the importance of these evolutionary and ecological processes in cancer, but to date, no system has been proposed for drawing clinically relevant distinctions between how different tumours are evolving. On the basis of a consensus conference of experts in the fields of cancer evolution and cancer ecology, we propose a framework for classifying tumours that is based on four relevant components. These are the diversity of neoplastic cells (intratumoural heterogeneity) and changes over time in that diversity, which make up an evolutionary index (Evo-index), as well as the hazards to neoplastic cell survival and the resources available to neoplastic cells, which make up an ecological index (Eco-index). We review evidence demonstrating the importance of each of these factors and describe multiple methods that can be used to measure them. Development of this classification system holds promise for enabling clinicians to personalize optimal interventions based on the evolvability of the patient’s tumour. The Evo- and Eco-indices provide a common lexicon for communicating about how neoplasms change in response to interventions, with potential implications for clinical trials, personalized medicine and basic cancer research.},

We consider an evolutionary model in relation to two mechanistic frameworks of cancer biology: multistage carcinogenesis and the hallmarks of cancer. The multistage model predicts that cancer risk increases with body size and longevity; however, this is not observed across species (Peto's paradox), but the paradox is resolved by invoking the evolution of additional genetic mechanisms to suppress cancer in large, long-lived species. It is when cancer cells overcome these defence mechanisms that they exhibit the hallmarks of cancer, driving the ongoing evolution of these defences, which in turn is expected to create the differences observed in the genetics of cancer across species and tissues. To illustrate the utility of an evolutionary model we examined some recently published data linking stem-cell divisions and cancer incidence across a range of tissues and show why the original analysis was faulty, and demonstrate that the data are consistent with a multistage model varying from three to seven mutational hits across different tissues. Finally, we demonstrate how an evolutionary model can both define patterns of inherited (familial) cancer and explain the prevalence of cancer in post-reproductive years, including the dominance of epithelial cancers.},

This means, all else being equal, selection for cancer suppression should dramatically drop after reproductive age. However, in species with significant parental investment, the capacity to enhance inclusive fitness may increase the reproductive value of older individuals or even those past reproductive age. Variation in parental investment levels could therefore contribute to variation in cancer susceptibility across species. In this article, we describe a simple model and framework for the evolution of cancer suppression with varying levels of parental investment and use this model to make testable predictions about variation in cancer suppression across species. This model can be extended to show that selection for cancer suppression is stronger in species with cooperative breeding systems and intergenerational transfers. We consider three cases that can select for cancer suppression into old age: (i) extended parental care that increases the survivorship of their offspring, (ii) grandparents contributing to higher fecundity of their children and (iii) cooperative breeding where helpers forgo reproduction or even survivorship to assist parents in having higher fecundity.},

The leading hypothesis to explain this pattern is natural selection for differential cancer prevention in larger, longer lived species. We evaluate whether a similar effect exists within species, specifically humans. We begin by reanalysing a recently published dataset to separate the effects of stem cell number and replication rate, and show that each has an independent effect on cancer risk. When considering the lifetime number of stem cell divisions in an extended dataset, and removing cases associated with other diseases or carcinogens, we find that lifetime cancer risk per tissue saturates at approximately 0.3–1.3\% for the types considered. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most of the remaining variation. Our results indicate that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions but varies enormously (approx. 10 000 times) depending on anatomical site. We conclude that variation in risk of human cancer types is analogous to the paradoxical lack of variation in cancer incidence among animal species and may likewise be understood as a result of evolution by natural selection.},

	abstract = {Studies of body size evolution, and life-history theory in general, are conducted without taking into account cancer as a factor that can end an organism's reproductive lifespan. This reflects a tacit assumption that predation, parasitism and starvation are of overriding importance in the wild. We argue here that even if deaths directly attributable to cancer are a rarity in studies of natural populations, it remains incorrect to infer that cancer has not been of importance in shaping observed life histories. We present first steps towards a cancer-aware life-history theory, by quantifying the decrease in the length of the expected reproductively active lifespan that follows from an attempt to grow larger than conspecific competitors. If all else is equal, a larger organism is more likely to develop cancer, but, importantly, many factors are unlikely to be equal. Variations in extrinsic mortality as well as in the pace of life—larger organisms are often near the slow end of the fast–slow life-history continuum—can make realized cancer incidences more equal across species than what would be observed in the absence of adaptive responses to cancer risk (alleviating the so-called Peto's paradox). We also discuss reasons why patterns across species can differ from within-species predictions. Even if natural selection diminishes cancer susceptibility differences between species, within-species differences can remain. In many sexually dimorphic cases, we predict males to be more cancer-prone than females, forming an understudied component of sexual conflict.},

	abstract = {Despite advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted drug development, cancer remains a disease of high morbidity and mortality. The treatment of human cancer patients with chemotherapy has become commonplace and accepted over the past 100 years. In recent years, and with a similar incidence of cancer to people, the use of cancer chemotherapy drugs in veterinary patients such as the dog has also become accepted clinical practice. The poor predictability of tumour responses to cancer chemotherapy drugs in rodent models means that the standard drug development pathway is costly, both in terms of money and time, leading to many drugs failing in Phase I and {II} clinical trials. This has led to the suggestion that naturally occurring cancers in pet dogs may offer an alternative model system to inform rational drug development in human oncology. In this review, we will explore the species variation in tumour responses to conventional chemotherapy and highlight our understanding of the differences in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics between humans and dogs. Finally, we explore the potential hurdles that need to be overcome to gain the greatest value from comparative oncology studies.},

The interdisciplinary field of comparative oncology offers a unique and strong opportunity to learn more about universal cancer risk and development through epidemiology, genetic and genomic investigations. Working across species, researchers from human and veterinary medicine can combine scientific findings to understand more quickly the origins of cancer and translate these findings to novel therapies to benefit both human and animals. This review begins with the genetic origins of canines and their advantage in cancer research. We next focus on recent findings in comparative oncology related to inherited, or genetic, risk for tumour development. We then detail the somatic, or genomic, changes within tumours and the similarities between species. The shared cancers between humans and dogs that we discuss include sarcoma (osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, histiocytic sarcoma, hemangiosarcoma), haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia), bladder cancer, intracranial neoplasms (meningioma, glioma) and melanoma. Tumour risk in other animal species is also briefly discussed. As the field of genomics advances, we predict that comparative oncology will continue to benefit both humans and the animals that live among us.},

Such cancers are diagnosed in about one in three humans in ‘developed’ countries, with the most common sites affected being lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary and pancreas. By contrast, carcinomas are said to be rare in captive chimpanzees, which share more than 99\% protein sequence homology with humans (and possibly in other related ‘great apes’—bonobos, gorillas and orangutans). Simple ascertainment bias is an unlikely explanation, as these nonhuman hominids are recipients of excellent veterinary care in research facilities and zoos, and are typically subjected to necropsies when they die. In keeping with this notion, benign tumours and cancers that are less common in humans are well documented in this population. In this brief overview, we discuss other possible explanations for the reported rarity of carcinomas in our closest evolutionary cousins, including inadequacy of numbers surveyed, differences in life expectancy, diet, genetic susceptibility, immune responses or their microbiomes, and other potential environmental factors. We conclude that while relative carcinoma risk is a likely difference between humans and chimpanzees (and possibly other ‘great apes’), a more systematic survey of available data is required for validation of this claim.},

Infection-associated cancers are well documented in humans and domestic animals, less commonly reported in undomesticated captive animals, and rarely documented in nature. In this paper, we review the literature associating infectious agents with cancer to evaluate the reasons for this pattern. Non-malignant infectious neoplasms occur pervasively in multicellular life, but oncogenic progression to malignancy is often uncertain. Evidence from humans and domestic animals shows that non-malignant infectious neoplasms can develop into cancer, although generally with low frequency. Malignant neoplasms could be difficult to find in nature because of a low frequency of oncogenic transformation, short survival after malignancy and reduced survival prior to malignancy. Moreover, the evaluation of malignancy can be ambiguous in nature, because criteria for malignancy may be difficult to apply consistently across species. The information available in the literature therefore does not allow for a definitive assessment of the pervasiveness of infectious cancers in nature, but the presence of infectious neoplasias and knowledge about the progression of benign neoplasias to cancer is consistent with a widespread but largely undetected occurrence.},

	abstract = {The frequency of cancer is postulated to be proportional to the number of cells an animal possesses, as each cell is similarly exposed to mutagens with every cell division. Larger animals result from more cell divisions with more mutagenic exposure, and hence are expected to have higher frequencies of cancer. Yet, as stipulated by Peto's paradox, larger animals do not have the higher rates of cancers seen in smaller animals despite the significant differences in cell numbers and a longer lifetime that would expose larger animals to more mutagens. The rates of cancer appear to be inversely proportional to animal body size, which scales inversely with specific metabolic rates of mammals. Studies over the past 20 years have linked oncogenes and tumour suppressors to alterations in cancer metabolism, and conversely, mutations in metabolic genes have been documented to trigger tumorigenesis. The by-products and intermediates of metabolism, such as reactive oxygen species, oxoglutarate, citrate and acetate, all have the potential to mutate and alter the genome or epigenome. On the basis of these general observations, it is proposed that metabolic rates correlate with mutagenic rates, which are higher in small animals and give the mechanistic basis for Peto's paradox. The observations discussed in this overview collectively indicate that specific metabolic rate varies inversely with body size, which seems to support the hypothesis that metabolism drives tumorigenesis and accounts for Peto's paradox.},

This observation is known as Peto's paradox. How much would evolution have to change the parameters of somatic evolution in order to equalize the cancer risk between species that differ by orders of magnitude in size? Analysis of previously published models of colorectal cancer suggests that a two- to three-fold decrease in the mutation rate or stem cell division rate is enough to reduce a whale's cancer risk to that of a human. Similarly, the addition of one to two required tumour-suppressor gene mutations would also be sufficient. We surveyed mammalian genomes and did not find a positive correlation of tumour-suppressor genes with increasing body mass and longevity. However, we found evidence of the amplification of

However, this is not observed—a (Peto's) paradox that suggests large and/or long-lived species have evolved effective cancer suppression mechanisms.

Body size
              per se
              will not select for sufficient cancer suppression to explain the paradox. Rather, cancer suppression should be most extreme when the probability of non-cancer death decreases with age (e.g. alligators), maturation is delayed, fecundity rates are low and fecundity increases with age. Thus, the value of cancer suppression is predicted to be lowest in the vole (short lifespan, high fecundity) and highest in the naked mole rat (long lived with late female sexual maturity). The life history of pre-industrial humans likely selected for quite low levels of cancer suppression. In modern humans that live much longer, this level results in unusually high lifetime cancer risks. The model predicts a lifetime risk of 49\% compared with the current empirical value of 43\%.},

	abstract = {The factors influencing cancer susceptibility and why it varies across species are major open questions in the field of cancer biology. One underexplored source of variation in cancer susceptibility may arise from trade-offs between reproductive competitiveness (e.g. sexually selected traits, earlier reproduction and higher fertility) and cancer defence. We build a model that contrasts the probabilistic onset of cancer with other, extrinsic causes of mortality and use it to predict that intense reproductive competition will lower cancer defences and increase cancer incidence. We explore the trade-off between cancer defences and intraspecific competition across different extrinsic mortality conditions and different levels of trade-off intensity, and find the largest effect of competition on cancer in species where low extrinsic mortality combines with strong trade-offs. In such species, selection to delay cancer and selection to outcompete conspecifics are both strong, and the latter conflicts with the former. We discuss evidence for the assumed trade-off between reproductive competitiveness and cancer susceptibility. Sexually selected traits such as ornaments or large body size require high levels of cell proliferation and appear to be associated with greater cancer susceptibility. Similar associations exist for female traits such as continuous egg-laying in domestic hens and earlier reproductive maturity. Trade-offs between reproduction and cancer defences may be instantiated by a variety of mechanisms, including higher levels of growth factors and hormones, less efficient cell-cycle control and less {DNA} repair, or simply a larger number of cell divisions (relevant when reproductive success requires large body size or rapid reproductive cycles). These mechanisms can affect intra- and interspecific variation in cancer susceptibility arising from rapid cell proliferation during reproductive maturation, intrasexual competition and reproduction.},

We review the existing literature on cancer and cancer-like phenomena across life, not only focusing on complex multicellularity but also reviewing cancer-like phenomena across the tree of life more broadly. We find that cancer is characterized by a breakdown of the central features of cooperation that characterize multicellularity, including cheating in proliferation inhibition, cell death, division of labour, resource allocation and extracellular environment maintenance (which we term the five foundations of multicellularity). Cheating on division of labour, exhibited by a lack of differentiation and disorganized cell masses, has been observed in all forms of multicellularity. This suggests that deregulation of differentiation is a fundamental and universal aspect of carcinogenesis that may be underappreciated in cancer biology. Understanding cancer as a breakdown of multicellular cooperation provides novel insights into cancer hallmarks and suggests a set of assays and biomarkers that can be applied across species and characterize the fundamental requirements for generating a cancer.},

Imprinted genes of maternal and paternal origin favour different degrees of proliferation of particular cell types in which they reside. As a result, the set of genes favouring greater proliferation will be selected to evade controls on cell-cycle progression imposed by the set of genes favouring lesser proliferation. The dynamics of stem cell populations will be a particular focus of this intragenomic conflict. Gene networks that are battlegrounds of intragenomic conflict are expected to be less robust than networks that evolve in the absence of conflict.

This special issue focuses on discoveries of these deeper evolutionary phenomena in the emerging area of ‘comparative oncology’. Comparing cancer dynamics in different tissues or species can lead to insights into how biology and ecology have led to differences in carcinogenesis, and the diversity, incidence and lethality of cancers. In this introduction to the special issue, we review the history of the field and outline how the contributions use empirical, comparative and theoretical approaches to address the processes and patterns associated with ‘Peto's paradox’, the lack of a statistical relationship of cancer incidence with body size and longevity. This burgeoning area of research can help us understand that cancer is not only a disease but is also a driving force in biological systems and species life histories.

	abstract = {An increased appreciation of the ubiquity of cancer risk across the tree of life means we also need to understand the more robust cancer defences some species seem to have. Peto’s paradox, the ﬁnding that large-bodied species do not suﬀer from more cancer even if their lives require far more cell divisions than those of small species, can be explained if large size selects for better cancer defences. Since birds live longer than non-ﬂying mammals of an equivalent body size, and birds are descendants of moderate-sized dinosaurs, we ask whether ancestral cancer defence innovations are retained if body size shrinks in an evolutionary lineage. Our model derives selection coeﬃcients and ﬁxation events for gains and losses of cancer defence innovations over macroevolutionary time, based on known relationships between body size, intrinsic cancer risk, extrinsic mortality (modulated by ﬂight ability) and eﬀective population size. We show that evolutionary lags can, under certain assumptions, explain why birds, descendants of relatively large bodied dinosaurs, retain low cancer risk. Counterintuitively, it is possible for a bird to be ‘too robust’ for its own good: excessive cancer suppression can take away from reproductive success. On the other hand, an evolutionary history of good cancer defences may also enable birds to reap the lifespan-increasing beneﬁts of other innovations such as ﬂight.},

We identify oscillators using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical modelling framework to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than colon (6.5 ± 1.0 vs 5.8 ± 1.7 stem cells/crypt) with slower stem cell replacement in small intestine (0.79 ± 0.5 vs 1.1 ± 0.8 replacements/stem cell/year).

	abstract = {Mutant evolution in spatially structured systems is important for a range of biological systems, but aspects of it still require further elucidation. Adding to previous work, we provide a simple derivation of growth laws that characterize the number of mutants of different relative ﬁtness in expanding populations in spatial models of different dimensionalities. These laws are universal and independent of “microscopic” modeling details. We further study the accumulation of mutants and ﬁnd that, with advantageous and neutral mutants, more of them are present in spatially structured, compared to well-mixed colonies of the same size. The behavior of disadvantageous mutants is subtle: if they are disadvantageous through a reduction in division rates, the result is the same, and it is the opposite if the disadvantage is due to a death rate increase. Finally, we show that in all cases, the same results are observed in fragmented, nonspatial patch models. This suggests that the patterns observed are the consequence of population fragmentation, and not spatial restrictions per se. We provide an intuitive explanation for the complex dependence of disadvantageous mutant evolution on spatial restriction, which relies on desynchronized dynamics in different locations/patches, and plays out differently depending on whether the disadvantage is due to a lower division rate or a higher death rate. Implications for speciﬁc biological systems, such as the evolution of drug-resistant cell mutants in cancer or bacterial bioﬁlms, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The simulation of stochastic reaction–diffusion systems using fine-grained representations can become computationally prohibitive when particle numbers become large. If particle numbers are sufficiently high then it may be possible to ignore stochastic fluctuations and use a more efficient coarse-grained simulation approach. Nevertheless, for multiscale systems which exhibit significant spatial variation in concentration, a coarse-grained approach may not be appropriate throughout the simulation domain. Such scenarios suggest a hybrid paradigm in which a computationally cheap, coarse-grained model is coupled to a more expensive, but more detailed fine-grained model, enabling the accurate simulation of the fine-scale dynamics at a reasonable computational cost. In this paper, in order to couple two representations of reaction–diffusion at distinct spatial scales, we allow them to overlap in a ‘blending region’. Both modelling paradigms provide a valid representation of the particle density in this region. From one end of the blending region to the other, control of the implementation of diffusion is passed from one modelling paradigm to another through the use of complementary ‘blending functions’ which scale up or down the contribution of each model to the overall diffusion. We establish the reliability of our novel hybrid paradigm by demonstrating its simulation on four exemplar reaction–diffusion scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cancer results from a sequence of genetic and epigenetic changes which lead to a variety of abnormal phenotypes including increased proliferation and survival of somatic cells, and thus, to a selective advantage of pre-cancerous cells. The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary process has been experiencing increasing interest in recent years. Many efforts have been made to better understand and predict the progression to cancer using mathematical models; these mostly consider the evolution of a well-mixed cell population, even though pre-cancerous cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial tissues. In this study, we propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers a spatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive waves. This model is used to assess two different paradigms of asexual evolution that have been suggested to delineate the process of cancer progression. The standard scenario of periodic selection assumes that driver mutations are accumulated strictly sequentially over time. However, when the mutation supply is sufficiently high, clones may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic backgrounds, and clonal adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find that in the presence of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the waiting time for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized clones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger) mutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic length scale Lc. These characteristic features of clonal interference may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial structure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained from biopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely occurs in the progression of colon cancer, and possibly other cancers where spatial structure matters.},

However, it is often difficult to explore relationships between cellular-level properties and tissue-level outcomes when biological experiments are performed at a single scale only. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a multi-scale mathematical model which provides a clear framework to explore these connections across biological scales. Starting with an individual-based mechanical model of cell movement, we subsequently derive a novel coarse-grained system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of the cell density due to heterogeneous cellular properties. We demonstrate that solutions of the individual-based model converge to numerical solutions of the coarse-grained model, for both slowly-varying-in-space and rapidly-varying-in-space cellular properties. We discuss applications of the model, such as determining relative cellular-level properties and an interpretation of data from a breast cancer detection experiment.},

	abstract = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer’s ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

	abstract = {{TODO}: flesh out this sketch. Cancer is a disease with abnormal growth of tissue. This excessive growth stems ultimately from somatic mutations in genes. Only a fraction of all mutated genes contribute to cancer onset and/or progression, the so called driver genes. The driver genes can be identified by assessing selection by several methods. Here we look at two. One, by analyzing the clone size distribution from {VAF}. Two, by comparative genomics with dnds. Selection analysis is recently also done on healthy epithelial tissue, in order to assess driver gene dynamics. In particular, the clone size distribution can be analyzed. However, the exact clonal dynamics and extent of selection is still disputed. Here, we choose a mathematical model that incorporates a rigid structure, leading to polynomial growth of clones. We compare this to another model with exponential growth per clone. We identify three important factors that contribute to the clone size distribution. (i) the type of clone growth, (ii) number of stem cell divisions and (iii) the selective advantage. We infer parameter values and show empirically that the resulting clone size distribution for the polynomial growth model with moderate selection of 5\% is similar to experimental data in epidermis and esophagus, when nr. of stem cells divisions is accounted for. The exponential growth model cannot give similar dynamics to experimental data in any parameter setting. We test the computational model and assess dnds behaviour. We find a linear increase over time. We verify this on the experimental data, which shows a similar trend. Together, these findings suggest that evolutionary dynamics for different epithelium is similar and moderate positive selection necessary for the observed {CSD}.},

This is achieved by introducing a negative ecological feedback loop that suppresses ecological dynamics by forcing births and deaths to be coupled. We also investigate how ﬁtness, a measure of reproductive success used in evolutionary graph theory, is related to the lifehistory of individuals in terms of their birth and death rates. In simple networks, these ecologically motivated dynamics are used to provide new insight into the spread of adaptive mutations, both with and without clonal interference.

An individual-based model allows us to investigate the front behaviour for one or a small number of regions in which dispersal or growth of individuals is reduced to zero (obstacles) or increased above the background (hotspots), respectively. In a regime in which front dynamics is determined by a local front speed, irrespective of the microscopic origin, we (i) describe the effect of multiple inhomogeneities in the light of an event-based solution, (ii) find a slow-down due to obstacles that is dominated by the number density and width of obstacles, but not by their precise shape, and (iii) characterize a speedup and its dependence on hotspot strength and density. Our findings emphasise the importance of taking the dimensionality of the environment into account. A simulation-driven description of the effect of individual spatial inhomogeities on genetic diversity of the population front provides an outlook into further research.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem of asexual adaptation is that beneﬁcial substitutions are not efﬁciently accumulated in large populations: Beneﬁcial mutations often go extinct because they compete with one another in going to ﬁxation. It has been argued that such clonal interference may have led to the evolution of sex and recombination in well-mixed populations. Here, we study clonal interference, and mechanisms of its mitigation, in an evolutionary model of spatially structured populations with uniform selection pressure. Clonal interference is much more prevalent with spatial structure than without, due to the slow wave-like spread of beneﬁcial mutations through space. We ﬁnd that the adaptation speed of asexuals saturates when the linear habitat size exceeds a characteristic interference length, which becomes shorter with smaller migration and larger mutation rate. The limiting speed is proportional to m1/2 and m1/3 in linear and planar habitats, respectively, where the mutational supply m is the product of mutation rate and local population density. This scaling and the existence of a speed limit should be amenable to experimental tests as they fall far below predicted adaptation speeds for well-mixed populations (that scale as the logarithm of population size). Finally, we show that not only recombination, but also long-range migration is a highly efﬁcient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition in structured populations. Our conservative estimates of the interference length predict prevalent clonal interference in microbial colonies and bioﬁlms, so clonal competition should be a strong driver of both genetic and spatial mixing in those contexts.},

	abstract = {Many biological and physical systems exhibit behaviour at multiple spatial, temporal or population scales. Multiscale processes provide challenges when they are to be simulated using numerical techniques. While coarser methods such as partial differential equations are typically fast to simulate, they lack the individual-level detail that may be required in regions of low concentration or small spatial scale. However, to simulate at such an individual level throughout a domain and in regions where concentrations are high can be computationally expensive. Spatially coupled hybrid methods provide a bridge, allowing for multiple representations of the same species in one spatial domain by partitioning space into distinct modelling subdomains. Over the past 20 years, such hybrid methods have risen to prominence, leading to what is now a very active research area across multiple disciplines including chemistry, physics and mathematics. There are three main motivations for undertaking this review. Firstly, we have collated a large number of spatially extended hybrid methods and presented them in a single coherent document, while comparing and contrasting them, so that anyone who requires a multiscale hybrid method will be able to find the most appropriate one for their need. Secondly, we have provided canonical examples with algorithms and accompanying code, serving to demonstrate how these types of methods work in practice. Finally, we have presented papers that employ these methods on real biological and physical problems, demonstrating their utility. We also consider some open research questions in the area of hybrid method development and the future directions for the field.},

However, the relationship between this marker and its clinical impact is mediated by an evolutionary process that is not well understood. Here, we employ a spatial computational model of tumour evolution to assess when, why and how intratumour heterogeneity can be used to forecast tumour growth rate and progression-free survival. We identify three conditions that can lead to a positive correlation between clonal diversity and subsequent growth rate: diversity is measured early in tumour development; selective sweeps are rare; and/or tumours vary in the rate at which they acquire driver mutations. Opposite conditions typically lead to negative correlation. In cohorts of tumours with diverse evolutionary parameters, we find that clonal diversity is a reliable predictor of both growth rate and progression-free survival. We thus offer explanations—grounded in evolutionary theory—for empirical findings in various cancers, including survival analyses reported in the recent {TRACERx} Renal study of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Our work informs the search for new prognostic biomarkers and contributes to the development of predictive oncology.},

	shorttitle = {Tree balance indices},
	abstract = {Tree balance plays an important role in phylogenetics and other research areas, which is why several indices to measure tree balance have been introduced over the years. Nevertheless, a formal definition of what a balance index actually is and what makes it a useful measure of balance (or, in other cases, imbalance), has so far not been introduced in the literature. While the established indices all summarize the (im)balance of a tree in a single number, they vary in their definitions and underlying principles. It is the aim of the present manuscript to introduce formal definitions of balance and imbalance indices that classify desirable properties of such indices and to analyze and categorize established indices accordingly. In this regard, we review 19 established (im)balance indices from the literature, summarize their general, statistical and combinatorial properties (where known), prove numerous additional results and indicate directions for future research by making explicit open questions and gaps in the literature. We also prove that a few tree shape statistics that have been used to measure tree balance in the literature do not fulfill our definition of an (im)balance index, which might indicate that their properties are not as useful for practical purposes. Moreover, we show that five additional tree shape statistics from other contexts actually are tree (im)balance indices according to our definition. The manuscript is accompanied by the website {\textbackslash}url\{treebalance.wordpress.com\} containing fact sheets of the discussed indices. Moreover, we introduce the software package {\textbackslash}verb{\textbar}treebalance{\textbar} implemented in \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{R\}\$ that can be used to calculate all indices discussed.},

Many computational methods produce clone phylogenies from population bulk sequencing data collected from multiple tumor samples from a patient. These clone phylogenies are used to infer mutation order and clone origins during tumor progression, rendering the selection of the appropriate clonal deconvolution method critical. Surprisingly, absolute and relative accuracies of these methods in correctly inferring clone phylogenies are yet to consistently assessed. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of seven computational methods. The accuracy of the reconstructed mutation order and inferred clone groupings varied extensively among methods. All the tested methods showed limited ability to identify ancestral clone sequences present in tumor samples correctly. The presence of copy number alterations, the occurrence of multiple seeding events among tumor sites during metastatic tumor evolution, and extensive intermixture of cancer cells among tumors hindered the detection of clones and the inference of clone phylogenies for all methods tested. Overall, {CloneFinder}, {MACHINA}, and {LICHeE} showed the highest overall accuracy, but none of the methods performed well for all simulated datasets. So, we present guidelines for selecting methods for data analysis.},

We focus on complete algorithms, including solutions to likelihood-restricted prior sampling, parallelisation, termination and diagnostics. The relation between number of live points, dimensionality and computational cost is studied for two complete algorithms. A new formulation of {NS} is presented, which casts the parameter space exploration as a search on a tree. Previously published ways of obtaining robust error estimates and dynamic variations of the number of live points are presented as special cases of this formulation. A new on-line diagnostic test is presented based on previous insertion rank order work. The survey of nested sampling methods concludes with outlooks for future research.},

	abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or “transition” type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimidine, the difference is called type {II} (or “transversion” type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type {II} differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = — (1/2) ln \{(1 — 2P — Q) \}. The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the synonymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is estimated by K'S = — (1/2) ln (1 — 2P — Q). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin sequences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution.},

Corrected p-values are then computed, and the statistical power of these statistics for testing the Yule model against a model of biased speciation is evaluated from simulations. As an illustration, the tests are applied to the {HIV}-1 reconstructed phylogeny. Ó 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The resulting clone has an enhanced growth rate, which generates a local ensemble of faster growing cells, thereby distorting the spherical shape of the tumor. We derive formulas for the abundance and diversity of additional driver mutations as function of time. Our model is semi-deterministic: the spatial growth of cancer clones is deterministic, while mutants arise stochastically.},

	abstract = {A number of successful systemic therapies are available for treatment of disseminated cancers. However, tumor response is often transient, and therapy frequently fails due to emergence of resistant populations. The latter reflects the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment as well as the evolutionary capacity of cancer phenotypes to adapt to therapeutic perturbations. Although cancers are highly dynamic systems, cancer therapy is typically administered according to a fixed, linear protocol. Here we examine an adaptive therapeutic approach that evolves in response to the temporal and spatial variability of tumor microenvironment and cellular phenotype as well as therapy-induced perturbations. Initial mathematical models find that when resistant phenotypes arise in the untreated tumor, they are typically present in small numbers because they are less fit than the sensitive population. This reflects the “cost” of phenotypic resistance such as additional substrate and energy used to up-regulate xenobiotic metabolism, and therefore not available for proliferation, or the growth inhibitory nature of environments (i.e., ischemia or hypoxia) that confer resistance on phenotypically sensitive cells. Thus, in the Darwinian environment of a cancer, the fitter chemosensitive cells will ordinarily proliferate at the expense of the less fit chemoresistant cells. The models show that, if resistant populations are present before administration of therapy, treatments designed to kill maximum numbers of cancer cells remove this inhibitory effect and actually promote more rapid growth of the resistant populations. We present an alternative approach in which treatment is continuously modulated to achieve a fixed tumor population. The goal of adaptive therapy is to enforce a stable tumor burden by permitting a significant population of chemosensitive cells to survive so that they, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit but chemoresistant subpopulations. Computer simulations show that this strategy can result in prolonged survival that is substantially greater than that of high dose density or metronomic therapies. The feasibility of adaptive therapy is supported by in vivo experiments.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that a strategy aiming for containment, not elimination, can control tumour burden more effectively in vitro, in mouse models and in the clinic. These outcomes are consistent with the hypothesis that emergence of resistance to cancer therapy may be prevented or delayed by exploiting competitive ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumour cell subpopulations. However, although various mathematical and computational models have been proposed to explain the superiority of particular containment strategies, this evolutionary approach to cancer therapy lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation. Here we combine extensive mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to establish general conditions under which a containment strategy is expected to control tumour burden more effectively than applying the maximum tolerated dose. We show that containment may substantially outperform more aggressive treatment strategies even if resistance incurs no cellular fitness cost. We further provide formulas for predicting the clinical benefits attributable to containment strategies in a wide range of scenarios and compare the outcomes of theoretically optimal treatments with those of more practical protocols. Our results strengthen the rationale for clinical trials of evolutionarily informed cancer therapy, while also clarifying conditions under which containment might fail to outperform standard of care.},

In this paper, we develop a new three phase model of nutrient-limited, avascular tumour growth to investigate how dead material within the tumour may influence the tumour’s growth dynamics. We model the tumour as a mixture of tumour cells, dead cellular material and extracellular fluid. The model equations are derived using mass and momentum balances for each phase along with appropriate constitutive equations. The tumour cells are viewed as a viscous fluid pressure, while the extracellular fluid phase is viewed as inviscid. The physical properties of the dead material are intermediate between those of the tumour cells and extracellular fluid, and are characterised by three key parameters. Through numerical simulation of the model equations, we reproduce spatial structures and dynamics typical of those associated with the growth of avascular tumour spheroids. We also characterise novel, non-monotonic behaviours which are driven by the internal dynamics of the dead material within the tumour. Investigations of the parameter sub-space describing the properties of the dead material reveal that the way in which non-viable tumour cells are modelled may significantly influence the qualitative tumour growth dynamics.},

	abstract = {Cancers are rarely caused by single mutations, but often develop as a result of the combined effects of multiple mutations. For most cells, the number of possible cell divisions is limited because of various biological constraints, such as progressive telomere shortening, cell senescence cascades or a hierarchically organized tissue structure. Thus, the risk of accumulating cells carrying multiple mutations is low. Nonetheless, many diseases are based on the accumulation of such multiple mutations. We model a general, hierarchically organized tissue by a multi-compartment approach, allowing any number of mutations within a cell. We derive closed solutions for the deterministic clonal dynamics and the reproductive capacity of single clones. Our results hold for the average dynamics in a hierarchical tissue characterized by an arbitrary combination of proliferation parameters. We show that hierarchically organized tissues strongly suppress cells carrying multiple mutations and derive closed solutions for the expected size and diversity of clonal populations founded by a single mutant within the hierarchy. We discuss the example of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in detail and find good agreement between our predicted results and recently observed clonal diversities in patients. This result can contribute to the explanation of very diverse mutation profiles observed by whole genome sequencing of many different cancers.},

The model predicts a {pH} gradient extending from the tumor-host interface, which is confirmed by reanalysis of existing experimental data. Investigation of the structure and dynamics of the tumor-host interaction within the context of the model demonstrates a transition from benign to malignant growth analogous to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The effect of biological parameters critical to controlling this transition are supported by experimental and clinical observations. Tumor wave front velocities determined via a marginal stability analysis of the model equations are consistent with in vivo tumor growth rates. The model predicts a previously unrecognized hypocellular interstitial gap at the tumor-host interface which we demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro. A direct correlation between the interfacial morphology and tumor wave front velocity provides an explicit, testable, clinically important prediction.},

	shorttitle = {On Sackin’s original proposal},
	abstract = {Background: The Sackin index S of a rooted phylogenetic tree, defined as the sum of its leaves’ depths, is one of the most popular balance indices in phylogenetics, and Sackin’s paper (Syst Zool 21:225–6, 1972) is usually cited as the source for this index. However, what Sackin actually proposed in his paper as a measure of the imbalance of a rooted tree was not the sum of its leaves’ depths, but their “variation”. This proposal was later implemented as the variance of the leaves’ depths by Kirkpatrick and Slatkin in (Evolution 47:1171–81, 1993), where they also posed the problem of finding a closed formula for its expected value under the Yule model. Nowadays, Sackin’s original proposal seems to have passed into oblivion in the phylogenetics literature, replaced by the index bearing his name, which, in fact, was introduced a decade later by Sokal.
Results: In this paper we study the properties of the variance of the leaves’ depths, V, as a balance index. Firstly, we prove that the rooted trees with n leaves and maximum V value are exactly the combs with n leaves. But although V achieves its minimum value on every space {BT} n of bifurcating rooted phylogenetic trees with n ≤ 183 leaves at the so-called “maximally balanced trees” with n leaves, this property fails for almost every n ≥ 184. We provide then an algorithm that finds the trees in {BT} n with minimum V value in time O(n log(n)). Secondly, we obtain closed formulas for the expected V value of a bifurcating rooted tree with any number n of leaves under the Yule and the uniform models and, as a by-product of the computations leading to these formulas, we also obtain closed formulas for the variance under the uniform model of the Sackin index and the total cophenetic index (Mir et al., Math Biosci 241:125–36, 2013) of a bifurcating rooted tree, as well as of their covariance, thus filling this gap in the literature.
Conclusion: The phylogenetics community has been wise in preferring the sum S(T) of the leaves’ depths of a phylogenetic tree T over their variance V(T) as a balance index, because the latter does not seem to capture correctly the notion of balance of large bifurcating rooted trees. But it is still a valid and useful shape index.},

	abstract = {Recently available cancer sequencing data have revealed a complex view of the cancer genome containing a multitude of mutations, including drivers responsible for cancer progression and neutral passengers. Measuring selection in cancer and distinguishing drivers from passengers have important implications for development of novel treatment strategies. It has recently been argued that a third of cancers are evolving neutrally, as their mutational frequency spectrum follows a 1/f power law expected from neutral evolution in a particular intermediate frequency range. We study a stochastic model of cancer evolution and derive a formula for the probability distribution of the cancer cell frequency of a subclonal driver, demonstrating that driver frequency is biased towards 0 and 1. We show that it is difficult to capture a driver mutation at an intermediate frequency, and thus the calling of neutrality due to a lack of such driver will significantly overestimate the number of neutrally evolving tumors. Our approach provides quantification of the validity of the 1/f statistic across the entire range of relevant parameter values. We also show that our conclusions remain valid for non-exponential models: spatial 3d model and sigmoidal growth, relevant for early- and late stages of cancer growth.},

Several indices, sensitive to different aspects of tree balance, are compared.

Different tree-forming algorithms may result in trees with differing degrees of balance no matter which index is computed. Tree balance is an important consideration for phylogenetic systematics, because balance of the true phylogeny will affect the accuracy of its estimates.},

	abstract = {Measures of tree balance play an important role in the analysis of phylogenetic trees. One of the oldest and most popular indices in this regard is the Colless index for rooted bifurcating trees, introduced by Colless (Syst Zool 31:100–104, 1982). While many of its statistical properties under different probabilistic models for phylogenetic trees have already been established, little is known about its minimum value and the trees that achieve it. In this manuscript, we fill this gap in the literature. To begin with, we derive both recursive and closed expressions for the minimum Colless index of a tree with n leaves. Surprisingly, these expressions show a connection between the minimum Colless index and the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve. We then fully characterize the tree shapes that achieve this minimum value and we introduce both an algorithm to generate them and a recurrence to count them. After focusing on two extremal classes of trees with minimum Colless index (the maximally balanced trees and the greedy from the bottom trees), we conclude by showing that all trees with minimum Colless index also have minimum Sackin index, another popular balance index.},

It is one of the most popular phylogenetic balance indices, because, in addition to measuring the balance of a tree in a very simple and intuitive way, it turns out to be one of the most powerful and discriminating phylogenetic shape indices. But it has some drawbacks. On the one hand, although its minimum value is reached at the so-called maximally balanced trees, it is almost always reached also at trees that are not maximally balanced. On the other hand, its definition as a sum of absolute values of differences makes it difficult to study analytically its distribution under probabilistic models of bifurcating phylogenetic trees. In this paper we show that if we replace in its definition the absolute values of the differences of clade sizes by the squares of these differences, all these drawbacks are overcome and the resulting index is still more powerful and discriminating than the original Colless index.},

This index makes sense for arbitrary trees, can be computed in linear time and it has a larger range of values and a greater resolution power than other indices like Colless’ or Sackin’s. We compute its maximum and minimum values for arbitrary and binary trees, as well as exact formulas for its expected value for binary trees under the Yule and the uniform models of evolution.

            We use a computational modeling approach to explore whether it is possible to infer a solid tumor’s cellular proliferative hierarchy under the assumptions of the cancer stem cell hypothesis and neutral evolution. We work towards inferring the symmetric division probability for cancer stem cells, since this is believed to be a key driver of progression and therapeutic response. Motivated by the advent of multiregion sampling and resulting opportunities to infer tumor evolutionary history, we focus on a suite of statistical measures of the phylogenetic trees resulting from the tumor’s evolution in different regions of parameter space and through time. We find strikingly different patterns in these measures for changing symmetric division probability which hinge on the inclusion of spatial constraints. These results give us a starting point to begin stratifying tumors by this biological parameter and also generate a number of actionable clinical and biological hypotheses regarding changes during therapy, and through tumor evolutionary time.

	abstract = {Background:
To predict the behavior of biological systems, mathematical models of biological systems have been shown to be useful. In particular, mathematical models of tumor-immune system interactions have demonstrated promising results in prediction of different behaviors of tumor against the immune system.

Methods:
This study aimed at the introduction of a new model of tumor-immune system interaction, which includes tumor and immune cells as well as myeloid-derived suppressor cells ({MDSCs}). {MDSCs} are immune suppressor cells that help the tumor cells to escape the immune system. The structure of this model is agent-based which makes possible to investigate each component as a separate agent. Moreover, in this model, the effect of low dose 5-fluorouracil (5-{FU}) on {MDSCs} depletion was considered.

Results:
Based on the findings of this study, {MDSCs} had suppressive effect on increment of immune cell number which consequently result in tumor cells escape the immune cells. It has also been demonstrated that low-dose 5-{FU} could help immune system eliminate the tumor cells through {MDSCs} depletion.

Conclusion:
Using this new agent-based model, multiple injection of low-dose 5-{FU} could eliminate {MDSCs} and therefore might have the potential to be considered in treatment of cancers.},

Yet, the emergence of these mutational jackpot events is only understood in well-mixed populations, where they stem from mutations that arise during the first few cell divisions. To study jackpot events in spatially structured populations, we track mutant clones in microbial populations using fluorescence microscopy and population sequencing. High-frequency mutations are found to be massively enriched in microbial colonies compared with well-shaken liquid cultures, as a result of late-occurring mutations surfing at the edge of range expansions. Thus, jackpot events can be generated not only when mutations arise early but also when they occur at favourable locations, which exacerbates their role in adaptation and disease. In particular, because spatial competition with the wild type keeps most mutant clones in a quiescent state, strong selection pressures that kill the wild type promote drug resistance.},

The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment.

Agent-based modeling is a specific discrete-based hybrid modeling approach that allows simulating the role of diversity in cell populations as well as within each individual cell; it has therefore become a powerful modeling method widely used by computational cancer researchers. Many aspects of tumor morphology including phenotype-changing mutations, the adaptation to microenvironment, the process of angiogenesis, the influence of extracellular matrix, reactions to chemotherapy or surgical intervention, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and metastasis and invasion of healthy tissues have been incorporated and investigated in agent-based models. In this review, we introduce some of the most recent agent-based models that have provided insight into the understanding of cancer growth and invasion, spanning multiple biological scales in time and space, and we further describe several experimentally testable hypotheses generated by those models. We also discuss some of the current challenges of multiscale agent-based cancer models.},

	abstract = {The key processes in biological and chemical systems are described by networks of chemical reactions. From molecular biology to biotechnology applications, computational models of reaction networks are used extensively to elucidate their non-linear dynamics. The model dynamics are crucially dependent on the parameter values which are often estimated from observations. Over the past decade, the interest in parameter and state estimation in models of (bio-) chemical reaction networks ({BRNs}) grew considerably. The related inference problems are also encountered in many other tasks including model calibration, discrimination, identifiability, and checking, and optimum experiment design, sensitivity analysis, and bifurcation analysis. The aim of this review paper is to examine the developments in literature to understand what {BRN} models are commonly used, and for what inference tasks and inference methods. The initial collection of about 700 documents concerning estimation problems in {BRNs} excluding books and textbooks in computational biology and chemistry were screened to select over 270 research papers and 20 graduate research theses. The paper selection was facilitated by text mining scripts to automate the search for relevant keywords and terms. The outcomes are presented in tables revealing the levels of interest in different inference tasks and methods for given models in the literature as well as the research trends are uncovered. Our findings indicate that many combinations of models, tasks and methods are still relatively unexplored, and there are many new research opportunities to explore combinations that have not been considered—perhaps for good reasons. The most common models of {BRNs} in literature involve differential equations, Markov processes, mass action kinetics, and state space representations whereas the most common tasks are the parameter inference and model identification. The most common methods in literature are Bayesian analysis, Monte Carlo sampling strategies, and model fitting to data using evolutionary algorithms. The new research problems which cannot be directly deduced from the text mining data are also discussed.},

	title = {Phenotypic plasticity and genetic control in colorectal cancer evolution},
	abstract = {Cancer evolution is driven by natural selection acting upon phenotypic trait variation. However, the extent to which phenotypic variation within a tumour is a consequence of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity remains undetermined. Here we show that colorectal cancer cells frequently have highly plastic phenotypic traits in vivo in patient tumours. We measured the degree to which trait variation reflects genetic ancestry by quantifying the phylogenetic signal of gene expression across 297 samples with multi-region paired whole genome and transcriptome sequencing collected from 27 primary colorectal cancers. Within-tumour phylogenetic signal for genes and pathways was detected only infrequently, suggesting that the majority of intra-tumour variation in gene expression programmes was not strongly heritable. Expression quantitative trait loci analyses ({eQTL}) identified a small number of putative mechanisms of genetic control of gene expression due to the cis-acting coding, non-coding and structural genetic alteration, but most gene expression variation was not explained by our genetic analysis. Leveraging matched chromatin-accessibility sequencing data, enhancer mutations with cis regulatory effects on gene expression were associated with a change in chromatin accessibility, indicating that non-coding variation can have phenotypic consequence through modulation of the 3D architecture of the genome. This study maps the evolution of transcriptional variation during cancer evolution, highlighting that intra-tumour phenotypic plasticity is pervasive in colorectal malignancies, and may play key roles in further tumour evolution, from metastasis to therapy resistance.},

	abstract = {Cancer genomic medicine relies on targeting driver genes. However, current catalogues of cancer drivers are mostly based on indirect measurements of mutation frequencies, positions or types, rather than their effect on clonal expansions in vivo. Moreover, nongenetic drivers are largely unknown, as are the epigenetic and transcriptomic effects of genetic drivers. Here we perform spatial computational inference on multiomic data with matched whole-genome sequencing, {ATAC}-seq and {RNA}-seq. Using 436 samples, we directly quantify the contribution, or lack thereof, of putative driver genes to subclonal expansions in vivo in 30 colorectal carcinomas (4-33 samples per patient, median=15). Although subclonal neutral evolution was widespread (13/26 cases with sufficient data), there were cases with clear evidence of subclonal selection (6/26) in which we measured epigenetic and transcriptomic differences between subclones in vivo. In 7/26 cases we could not distinguish between neutral or selective evolution with the available data. We identified expanding subclones that were not driven by known genetic alterations, and propose candidate epigenetic drivers. We identified the distinguishing patterns of genomic heterogeneity produced in fast, exponentially growing tumours (7/26) versus neoplasms growing only at the periphery (19/26), as well as identifying clonally intermixed (16/28 cases with sufficient data) versus segregated malignancies (10/28). Our model-based approach measures genetic and non-genetic subclonal selection, or lack thereof, in space and time and allows in vivo comparisons of the emergent phenotypic properties of subclones within human tumours.},

This work extends the conventional parametric species-neutral approach (based on ‘effective number of species’ or Hill numbers) to take into account species relatedness, and also generalizes the traditional phylogenetic approach (based on ‘total phylogenetic length’) to incorporate species abundances. The proposed measure quantifies ‘the mean effective number of species’ over any time interval of interest, or the ‘effective number of maximally distinct lineages’ over that time interval. The product of the measure and the interval length quantifies the ‘branch diversity’ of the phylogenetic tree during that interval. The new measures generalize and unify many existing measures and lead to a natural definition of taxonomic diversity as a special case. The replication principle (or doubling property), an important requirement for species-neutral diversity, is generalized to {PD}. The widely used Rao's quadratic entropy and the phylogenetic entropy do not satisfy this essential property, but a simple transformation converts each to our measures, which do satisfy the property. The proposed approach is applied to forest data for interpreting the effects of thinning.},

In our model, multiple subclones were generated by driver mutation acquisition and subsequent clonal expansion in early-stage tumors. Among the subclones, the one obtaining driver copy number alterations is endowed with malignant potentials to constitute a late-stage tumor in which extensive intratumor heterogeneity is generated by the accumulation of neutral mutations. We will also discuss how to translate our understanding of cancer evolution to a solution to the problem related to therapeutic resistance: mathematical modeling suggests that relapse caused by acquired resistance could be suppressed by utilizing clonal competition between sensitive and resistant clones. Considering the current rate of technological development, modeling cancer evolution by combining genomic analysis and mathematical modeling will be an increasingly important approach for understanding and overcoming cancer.},

With cancer progression, resistance to therapy, and metastastis in mind, we will investigate τk, the time of the first type k mutation, and σk, the time of the first type k mutation that founds a family line that does not die out, as well as the growth of the number of type k cells. The last three sections apply these results to metastasis, ovarian cancer, and tumor heterogeneity. Even though martingales and stable laws are mentioned, these notes should be accessible to a student who is familiar with Poisson processes and continuous time Markov chains. 1 Multistage theory of cancer Throughout these notes, we model cancer as an exponentially growing cell population in which type i cells are those that have accumulated i ≥ 0 mutations compared to the type 0 cells. To motivate the study of these models we begin with a brief and incomplete history lesson and a description of some situations in which our model may be applied. The idea that carcinogenesis is a multistage process goes back to the 1950s. Fisher and Holloman [52] pointed out that when the logarithm of cancer mortality from stomach cancer in women was plotted versus log of age, the result was line with slope 6. Nordling [65] and Armitage and Doll [43] suggested that the observed relationship would be explained if a cancer cell was the end result of seven mutations. There was no model.

The dominant theme of this Roadmap is the personalization of medicine through mathematics, modelling, and simulation. This is achieved through the use of patientspecific clinical data to: develop individualized screening strategies to detect cancer earlier; make predictions of response to therapy; design adaptive, patient-specific treatment plans to overcome therapy resistance; and establish domain-specific standards to share model predictions and to make models and simulations reproducible.

	abstract = {Understanding mutant evolution in spatially structured systems is crucially important for a range of biological systems, including bacterial populations and cancer. While previous work has shown that the mutation load is higher in spatially structured compared to well-mixed systems for neutral mutants in the absence of cell death, we demonstrate a significantly higher degree of complexity, using a comprehensive computational modeling approach that takes into account different mutant fitness, cell death, and different population structures. While an agent-based model assuming nearest neighbor interactions predicts a higher abundance of neutral or advantageous mutants compared to well-mixed systems of the same size, we show that for disadvantageous mutants, results depend on the nature of the disadvantage. In particular, if the disadvantage occurs through higher death rates, as opposed to lower reproduction rates, the result is the opposite, and a lower mutation load occurs in spatial compared to mixed systems. Interestingly, we show that in all cases, the same results are observed in fragmented patch models, where individuals can migrate to randomly chosen patches, thus lacking a strict spatial component. Hence, the results reported for spatial models are the consequence of population fragmentation, and not spatial restrictions per se. We further derive growth laws that characterize the expansion of wild type and mutant populations in different dimensionalities. For example, we find that while disadvantageous mutant abundance scales with the total population size, N, neutral mutants grow faster (as N2 for 1D, as N3/2 in 2D, and as N4/3 in 3D). Advantageous mutants scale with the cube of N in 1D and with the square of N in higher dimensions. These laws are universal (as long as mutants remain a minority) and independent of “microscopic” modeling details.},

We parameterize the model using experimentally measured parameter values, many of them only recently available, and compare its predictions to epidemiological data on colorectal cancer incidence. We find that the reported lifetime risk of colorectal cancer can be recovered using a mathematical model of colorectal cancer initiation together with experimentally measured mutation rates in colorectal tissues and proliferation rates of premalignant lesions. We demonstrate that the order of driver events in colorectal cancer is determined primarily by the fitness effects that they provide, rather than their mutation rates. Our results imply that there may not be significant immune suppression of untreated benign and malignant colorectal lesions.},

	abstract = {The metastasis of malignant epithelial tumors begins with the egress of transformed cells from the conﬁnes of their basement membrane ({BM}) to their surrounding collagen-rich stroma. Invasion can be morphologically diverse: when breast cancer cells are separately cultured within {BM}-like matrix, collagen I (Coll I), or a combination of both, they exhibit collective-, dispersed mesenchymal-, and a mixed collective-dispersed (multimodal)- invasion, respectively. In this paper, we asked how distinct these invasive modes are with respect to the cellular and microenvironmental cues that drive them. A rigorous computational exploration of invasion was performed within an experimentally motivated Cellular Pottsbased modeling environment. The model comprised of adhesive interactions between cancer cells, {BMand} Coll I-like extracellular matrix ({ECM}), and reaction–diffusion-based remodeling of {ECM}. The model outputs were parameters cognate to dispersed- and collective- invasion. A clustering analysis of the output distribution curated through a careful examination of subsumed phenotypes suggested at least four distinct invasive states: dispersed, papillary-collective, bulk-collective, and multimodal, in addition to an indolent/non-invasive state. Mapping input values to speciﬁc output clusters suggested that each of these invasive states are speciﬁed by distinct input signatures of proliferation, adhesion and {ECM} remodeling. In addition, speciﬁc input perturbations allowed transitions between the clusters and revealed the variation in the robustness between the invasive states. Our systems-level approach proffers quantitative insights into how the diversity in {ECM} microenvironments may steer invasion into diverse phenotypic modes during early dissemination of breast cancer and contributes to tumor heterogeneity.},

In well-mixed scenarios at the sub-cellular level it is often reasonable to assume that times between successive reaction/interaction events are exponentially distributed and can be appropriately modelled as a Markov process and hence simulated by the Gillespie algorithm. However, Gillespie’s algorithm is routinely applied to model biological systems for which it was never intended. In particular, processes in which cell proliferation is important (e.g. embryonic development, cancer formation) should not be simulated naively using the Gillespie algorithm since the history-dependent nature of the cell cycle breaks the Markov process. The variance in experimentally measured cell cycle times is far less than in an exponential cell cycle time distribution with the same mean.},

	abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity has been widely reported in human cancers, but our knowledge of how this genetic diversity emerges over time remains limited. A central challenge in studying tumor evolution is the difficulty in collecting longitudinal samples from cancer patients. Consequently, most studies have inferred tumor evolution from single time-point samples, providing very indirect information. These data have led to several competing models of tumor evolution: linear, branching, neutral and punctuated. Each model makes different assumptions regarding the timing of mutations and selection of clones, and therefore has different implications for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of cancer patients. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that models may change during tumor progression or operate concurrently for different classes of mutations. Finally, we discuss data that supports the theory that most human tumors evolve from a single cell in the normal tissue.

Accumulating evidence suggests that intratumor heterogeneity likely is the key to understanding treatment failure. However, the extent of intratumor heterogeneity as a result of tumor evolution is still poorly understood. To address this, we developed a unique surgical multisampling scheme to collect spatially distinct tumor fragments from 11 {GB} patients. We present an integrated genomic analysis that uncovers extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with most patients displaying different {GB} subtypes within the same tumor. Moreover, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the fragments for each patient, identifying copy number alterations in {EGFR} and {CDKN}2A/B/p14ARF as early events, and aberrations in {PDGFRA} and {PTEN} as later events during cancer progression. We also characterized the clonal organization of each tumor fragment at the single-molecule level, detecting multiple coexisting cell lineages. Our results reveal the genome-wide architecture of intratumor variability in {GB} across multiple spatial scales and patient-specific patterns of cancer evolution, with consequences for treatment design.},

These outcomes are consistent with the hypothesis that emergence of resistance to cancer therapy may be prevented or delayed by exploiting competitive ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant tumor cell subpopulations. However, although various mathematical and computational models have been proposed to explain the superiority of particular containment strategies, this evolutionary approach to cancer therapy lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation. Here we combine extensive mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to establish general conditions under which a containment strategy is expected to control tumor burden more effectively than applying the maximum tolerated dose. We show that when resistant cells are present, an idealized strategy of containing a tumor at a maximum tolerable size maximizes time to treatment failure (that is, the time at which tumor burden becomes intolerable). These results are very general and do not depend on any fitness cost of resistance. We further provide formulas for predicting the clinical benefits attributable to containment strategies in a wide range of scenarios, and we compare outcomes of theoretically optimal treatments with those of more practical protocols. Our results strengthen the rationale for clinical trials of evolutionarily-informed cancer therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In 1924 Yule observed that distributions of number of species per genus were typically long­tailed, and proposed a stochastic model to fit these data. Modern taxonomists often prefer to represent relationships between species via phylogenetic trees; the counterpart to Yule’s observation is that actual reconstructed trees look surprisingly unbalanced. The imbalance can readily be seen via a scatter diagram of the sizes of clades involved in the splits of published large phylogenetic trees. Attempting stochastic modeling leads to two puzzles. First, two somewhat opposite possible biological descriptions of what dominates the macroevolutionary process (adaptive radiation; “neutral” evolution) lead to exactly the same mathematical model (Markov or Yule or coalescent). Second, neither this nor any other simple stochastic model predicts the observed pattern of imbalance. This essay represents a probabilist’s musings on these puzzles, complementing the more detailed survey of biological literature by Mooers and Heard, Quart. Rev. Biol. 72 [(1997) 31–54].},

As yet, however, the vast catalogues of mutations that have been identified have made only a modest impact on clinical medicine. Massively parallel sequencing has informed our understanding of the genetic evolution and heterogeneity of cancers, allowing us to place these mutational catalogues into a meaningful context. Here, we review the methods used to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity, and the potential and challenges for translating the insights gained to achieve clinical impact for cancer therapy, monitoring, early detection, risk stratification, and prevention. We discuss how tumor evolution can guide cancer therapy by targeting clonal and subclonal mutations both individually and in combination. Circulating tumor {DNA} and circulating tumor cells can be leveraged for monitoring the efficacy of therapy and for tracking the emergence of resistant subclones. The evolutionary history of tumors can be deduced for late-stage cancers, either directly by sampling precursor lesions or by leveraging computational approaches to infer the timing of driver events. This approach can identify recurrent early driver mutations that represent promising avenues for future early detection strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that mutational processes and complex clonal dynamics are active even in normal development and aging. This will make discriminating developing malignant neoplasms from normal aging cell lineages a challenge. Furthermore, insight into signatures of mutational processes that are active early in tumor evolution may allow the development of cancer-prevention approaches. Research and clinical studies that incorporate an appreciation of the complex evolutionary patterns in tumors will not only produce more meaningful genomic data, but also better exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer, resulting in improved treatment outcomes.},

Here we introduce a new method, S/{HIC}, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/{HIC} has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover, we show that S/{HIC} is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus, even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/{HIC} still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally, we apply S/{HIC} to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample, and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.04.30.442123},
	abstract = {Abstract
          Non-heritable somatic mutations are typically associated with deleterious effects such as in cancer and senescence, so their role in adaptive evolution has received little attention. However, most somatic mutations are harmless and some even confer a fitness advantage to the organism carrying them. We hypothesized that heritable, germline genotypes that are likely to express an advantageous phenotype via non-heritable somatic mutation will have a selective advantage over other germline genotypes, and this advantage will channel evolving populations toward more fit germline genotypes, thus promoting adaptation. We tested this hypothesis by simulating evolving populations of developing organisms with an impermeable germline-soma separation navigating a minimal fitness landscape. The simulations revealed the conditions under which non-heritable somatic mutations promote adaptation. Specifically, this can occur when the somatic mutation supply is high, when only very few cells with the advantageous somatic mutation are required to increase organismal fitness, and when the somatic mutation also confers a selective advantage to cells with that mutation. We therefore provide proof-of-principle that non-heritable somatic mutations can promote adaptive evolution via a process we call somatic genotypic exploration. We discuss the biological plausibility of this phenomenon, as well as its evolutionary implications.
          
            Significance
            The immensity of non-heritable genetic diversity arising in the soma has been largely disregarded in evolutionary theory as a source of adaptation. Here, we introduce a model in which non-heritable somatic mutations arising during development confer an organismal fitness advantage. Analysis of this model shows how such mutations channel evolving populations toward adaptive germline genotypes. This is most likely to occur when somatic mutations confer a fitness benefit at both the cellular and organismal levels, evoking a synergistic form of multi-level selection that contrasts with the antagonistic forms typically associated with somatic mutations in cancer and senescence. As such, our study invites a new view of somatic genetic diversity in evolutionary theory as a potential source of adaptation.},

	abstract = {Computational models are quantitative representations of systems. By analyzing and comparing the outputs of such models, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the system itself. Though as the complexity of model outputs increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to compare simulations to each other. While it is straightforward to only compare a few specific model outputs across multiple simulations, additional useful information can come from comparing model simulations as a whole. However, it is difficult to holistically compare model simulations in an unbiased manner. To address these limitations, we use representation learning to transform model simulations into low-dimensional points, with the neural networks capturing the relationships between the model outputs without the need to manually specify which outputs to focus on. The distance in low-dimensional space acts as a comparison metric, reducing the difference between simulations to a single value. We provide an approach to training neural networks on model simulations and display how the trained networks can then be used to provide a holistic comparison of model outputs. This approach can be applied to a wide range of model types, providing a quantitative method of analyzing the complex outputs of computational models.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models ({ABMs}) have enabled great advances in the study of tumor development and therapeutic response, allowing researchers to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the tumor and its microenvironment. However, these models face serious drawbacks in the realm of parameterization – {ABM} parameters are typically set individually based on various data and literature sources, rather than through a rigorous parameter estimation approach. While {ABMs} can be fit to time-course data, that type of data loses the spatial information that is a defining feature of {ABMs}. Tumor images provide spatial information; however, such images only represent individual timepoints, limiting their utility in calibrating the tumor dynamics predicted by {ABMs}. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to compare tumor images to {ABM} simulations beyond a qualitative visual comparison. Without a quantitative method of comparing the similarity of tumor images to {ABM} simulations, a rigorous parameter fitting is not possible. Here, we present a novel approach that applies neural networks to represent both tumor images and {ABM} simulations as low dimensional points, with the distance between points acting as a quantitative measure of difference between the two. This enables a quantitative comparison of tumor images and {ABM} simulations, where the distance between simulated and experimental images can be minimized using standard parameter-fitting algorithms. Here, we describe this method and present two examples to demonstrate the application of the approach to estimate parameters for two distinct {ABMs}. Overall, we provide a novel method to robustly estimate {ABM} parameters.},

	abstract = {Tree balance plays an important role in diﬀerent research areas like theoretical computer science and mathematical phylogenetics. For example, it has long been known that under the Yule model, a pure birth process, imbalanced trees are more likely than balanced ones. Also, concerning ordered search trees, more balanced ones allow for more eﬃcient data structuring than imbalanced ones. Therefore, diﬀerent methods to measure the balance of trees were introduced. The Sackin index is one of the most frequently used measures for this purpose. In many contexts, statements about the minimal and maximal values of this index have been discussed, but formal proofs have only been provided for some of them, and only in the context of ordered binary (search) trees, not for general rooted trees. Moreover, while the number of trees with maximal Sackin index as well as the number of trees with minimal Sackin index when the number of leaves is a power of 2 are relatively easy to understand, the number of trees with minimal Sackin index for all other numbers of leaves has been completely unknown. In this manuscript, we extend the ﬁndings on trees with minimal and maximal Sackin indices from the literature on ordered trees and subsequently use our results to provide formulas to explicitly calculate the numbers of such trees. We also extend previous studies by analyzing the case when the underlying trees need not be binary. Finally, we use our results to contribute both to the phylogenetic as well as the computer scientiﬁc literature using the new ﬁndings on Sackin minimal and maximal trees to derive formulas to calculate the number of both minimal and maximal phylogenetic trees as well as minimal and maximal ordered trees both in the binary and non-binary settings. All our results have been implemented in the Mathematica package {SackinMinimizer}, which has been made publicly available.},

In the wake of these successes, {CNN}-based methods have emerged in remote sensing image scene classification and achieved advanced classification accuracy. In this review, which focuses on the application of {CNNs} to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art ({SOAT}) network architectures. Along the way, we analyze (1) the basic structure of artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) and the basic network layers of {CNNs}, (2) the classic predecessor network models, (3) the recent {SOAT} network algorithms, (4) comprehensive comparison of various image classification methods mentioned in this article.

Here, we provide a proof-of-principle synthetic supervised learning method, {TumE}, that integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks, to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies. Analyses in synthetic and patient tumours show that {TumE} significantly improves both accuracy and inference time per sample when detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency. Importantly, we show how transfer learning can leverage stored knowledge within {TumE} models for related evolutionary inference tasks—substantially reducing data and computational time for further model development and providing a library of recyclable deep learning models for the cancer evolution community. This extensible framework provides a foundation and future directions for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and, in turn, the cancer patient.},

In contrast to prior art that hand-crafts these simulation parameters or adjusts only parts of the available parameters, our approach fully controls the simulator with the actual underlying goal of maximizing accuracy, rather than mimicking the real data distribution or randomly generating a large volume of data.

By analyzing and comparing the outputs of such models, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the system itself. Though, as the complexity of model outputs increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to compare simulations to each other. While it is straightforward to only compare a few specific model outputs across multiple simulations, it is more informative to be able to compare model simulations as a whole. However, it is difficult to holistically compare model simulations in an unbiased manner. To address these limitations, we use Siamese neural networks to compare model simulations as a single value, with the neural networks capturing the relationships between the model outputs. We provide an approach to training Siamese networks on model simulations and display how the trained networks can then be used to provide a holistic comparison of model outputs. This approach can be applied to a wide range of model types, providing a quantitative method of analyzing the complex outputs of computational models.},

	abstract = {The footprint left by early cancer dynamics on the spatial arrangement of tumour cells is poorly understood, and yet could encode information about how therapy resistant sub-clones grew within the expanding tumour. Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population mixing. First, using a toy model of cell mixing we demonstrate how first passage time statistics can distinguish between different pattern structures. We then apply our method to simulated patterns of wild-type and mutated tumour cell population mixing, generated using an agent-based model of expanding tumours, to explore how first passage times reflect mutant cell replicative advantage, time of emergence and strength of cell pushing. Finally, we analyse experimentally measured patterns of genetic point mutations in human colorectal cancer, and estimate parameters of early sub-clonal dynamics using our spatial computational model. We uncover a wide range of mutant cell replicative advantages and timings, with the majority of sampled tumours consistent with boundary driven growth or short-range cell pushing. By analysing multiple sub-sampled regions in a small number of samples, we explore how the distribution of inferred dynamics could inform about the initial mutational event. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of first passage time analysis as a new methodology for quantifying cell mixing patterns in vivo, and suggest that patterns of sub-clonal mixing can provide insights into early cancer dynamics.},

Here, we have circumvented this problem by quantitatively using somatic {mtDNA} mutations to trace clonal lineages. By analyzing clonal imprints on the walls of colonic crypts, we show that human intestinal stem cells conform to one-dimensional neutral drift dynamics with a “functional” stem cell number of five to six in both normal patients and individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (germline {APC}−/+). Furthermore, we show that, in adenomatous crypts ({APC}−/−), there is a proportionate increase in both functional stem cell number and the loss/replacement rate. Finally, by analyzing fields of {mtDNA} mutant crypts, we show that a normal colon crypt divides around once every 30–40 years, and the division rate is increased in adenomas by at least an order of magnitude. These data provide in vivo quantification of human intestinal stem cell and crypt dynamics.,

Fixation requires two sequential steps. First, one of approximately seven active stem cells residing within each colonic crypt has to be mutated. Second, the mutated stem cell has to replace neighbors to populate the entire crypt in a process that takes several years. Subsequent clonal expansion due to crypt fission is infrequent for neutral mutations (around 0.7\% of all crypts undergo fission in a single year). Pro-oncogenic mutations subvert both stem cell replacement to accelerate fixation and clonal expansion by crypt fission to achieve high mutant allele frequencies with age. The benchmarking of these behaviors allows the advantage associated with different gene-specific mutations to be compared irrespective of the cellular mechanisms by which they are conferred.,

        , Winton and colleagues describe stem cell dynamics in normal human colon to identify the efficiency of clone fixation within the epithelium and the rate of subsequent lateral expansion. Against these benchmarks biased stem cell behaviors advantaged in both fixation and expansion can be quantified to predict the age-related burden of pro-oncogenic mutation.},

	abstract = {Mutation-mediated drug resistance is one of the primary causes for the failure of modern antibiotic or chemotherapeutic treatment. Yet, in the absence of treatment many drug resistance mutations are associated with a fitness cost and therefore subject to purifying selection. While, in principle, resistant subclones can escape purifying selection via subsequent compensatory mutations, current models predict such evolutionary rescue events to be exceedingly unlikely. Here, we show that the probability of evolutionary rescue, and the resulting long-term persistence of drug resistant subclones, is dramatically increased in dense microbial populations via an inflation-selection balance that stabilizes the less-fit intermediate state. Tracking the entire evolutionary trajectory of fluorescence-augmented “synthetic mutations” in expanding yeast colonies, we trace the origin of this balance to the opposing forces of radial population growth and a clone-width-dependent weakening of selection pressures, inherent to crowded populations. Additionally conducting agent-based simulations of tumor growth, we corroborate the fundamental nature of the observed effects and demonstrate the potential impact on drug resistance evolution in cancer. The described phenomena should be considered when predicting the evolutionary dynamics of any sufficiently dense cellular populations, including pathogenic microbial biofilms and solid tumors, and their response to therapeutic interventions. Our experimental approach could be extended to systematically study rates of specific evolutionary trajectories, giving quantitative access to the evolution of complex adaptations.},

            Characterizing the mode—the way, manner or pattern—of evolution in tumours is important for clinical forecasting and optimizing cancer treatment. Sequencing studies have inferred various modes, including branching, punctuated and neutral evolution, but it is unclear why a particular pattern predominates in any given tumour. Here we propose that tumour architecture is key to explaining the variety of observed genetic patterns. We examine this hypothesis using spatially explicit population genetics models and demonstrate that, within biologically relevant parameter ranges, different spatial structures can generate four tumour evolutionary modes: rapid clonal expansion, progressive diversification, branching evolution and effectively almost neutral evolution. Quantitative indices for describing and classifying these evolutionary modes are presented. Using these indices, we show that our model predictions are consistent with empirical observations for cancer types with corresponding spatial structures. The manner of cell dispersal and the range of cell–cell interactions are found to be essential factors in accurately characterizing, forecasting and controlling tumour evolution.},

	abstract = {In spatially constrained growing populations, such as tumors or biofilms, cells at the edge of expanding front have significant advantages because of the high accessibility to nutrients and spaces. Therefore, mutations that happen at the front have a large probability to surf at the edge of the population. A previous population sequencing study has shown that this effect leaves characteristic features in the mutation frequency spectrum. However, sequencing experiments cannot capture the behavior of low-frequency variants. Here, we constructed a microfluidic device to track mutations which happened at the front of a population growth. Combining with agent-based simulations and theoretical studies, we found that low-frequency mutant clones have broadly distributed shapes and sizes, which result from the combination of growth and excluded volume interactions. These results could be relevant to the emergence of drug resistance in crowded cellular populations.

We identify endogenous fluctuating {CpG} ({fCpG}) sites using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical model to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than the colon, with slower stem cell replacement in the small intestine. Germline {APC} mutation increased the number of replacements per crypt. In blood, we measured rapid expansion of acute leukemia and slower growth of chronic disease. Thus, the patterns of human somatic cell birth and death are measurable with fluctuating methylation clocks ({FMCs}).},

Across manifold scenarios, recurrent research questions are: how many cells exist with a given set of alterations, and how long will it take for these cells to appear. These questions have been tackled in special cases, often within a branching processes framework. However, the general situation of cells sequentially acquiring an arbitrary number of mutations which may be selectively advantageous, neutral, or disadvantageous remains unaddressed. Here, we consider this setting in the biologically relevant limiting regimes of large times and small mutation rates. We provide analytic expressions for the number, and arrival time, of cells with \$n\$ mutations. Universal probability distributions for both quantities are presented, and the consequences of our results on cancer driver mutation accumulation and bacterial fluctuation assays are highlighted.},

	abstract = {In theoretical physics, the term renormalization group ({RG}) refers to a formal apparatus that allows systematic  investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different scales. In particle physics, it reflects the changes in the underlying force laws (codified in a quantum field theory) as  the energy scale at which physical processes occur varies, energy/momentum  and resolution distance scales being effectively conjugate under the uncertainty principle.
A change in scale is called a scale transformation.  The renormalization group is intimately related to scale invariance and conformal invariance, symmetries in which a system appears the same at all scales (so-called self-similarity).As the scale varies, it is as if one is changing the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally be seen to consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may  relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc.  The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable couplings which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.
For example, in quantum electrodynamics ({QED}), an electron appears to be composed of electrons, positrons (anti-electrons) and photons, as one views it at higher resolution, at very short distances. The electron at such short distances has a slightly different electric charge than does the dressed electron seen at large distances, and this change, or running, in the value of the electric charge is determined by the renormalization group equation.},

Deep learning performs a sophisticated coarse graining. Since coarse graining is a key ingredient of the renormalization group ({RG}), {RG} may provide a useful theoretical framework directly relevant to deep learning. In this study we pursue this possibility. A statistical mechanics model for a magnet, the Ising model, is used to train an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine ({RBM}). The patterns generated by the trained {RBM} are compared to the configurations generated through an {RG} treatment of the Ising model. Although we are motivated by the connection between deep learning and {RG} flow, in this study we focus mainly on comparing a single layer of a deep network to a single step in the {RG} flow. We argue that correlation functions between hidden and visible neurons are capable of diagnosing {RG}-like coarse graining. Numerical experiments show the presence of {RG}-like patterns in correlators computed using the trained {RBMs}. The observables we consider are also able to exhibit important differences between {RG} and deep learning.},

Here we show, by identifying the conditional distribution in the restricted Boltzmann machine ({RBM}) and the weight factor distribution in the {RG} procedure, an optimal real-space {RG} transformation can be learned without prior knowledge of the physical system. This neural Monte Carlo {RG} algorithm allows for direct computation of the {RG} flow and critical exponents.

	abstract = {Motivated by the collective behavior of biological swarms, we study the critical dynamics of field theories with coupling between order parameter and conjugate momentum in the presence of dissipation. Under a fixed-network approximation, we perform a dynamical renormalization group calculation at one loop in the near-critical disordered region, and we show that the violation of momentum conservation generates a crossover between an unstable fixed point, characterized by a dynamic critical exponent z=d/2, and a stable fixed point with z=2. Interestingly, the two fixed points have different upper critical dimensions. The interplay between these two fixed points gives rise to a crossover in the critical dynamics of the system, characterized by a crossover exponent κ=4/d. The crossover is regulated by a conservation length scale R0, given by the ratio between the transport coefficient and the effective friction, which is larger as the dissipation is smaller: Beyond R0, the stable fixed point dominates, while at shorter distances dynamics is ruled by the unstable fixed point and critical exponent, a behavior which is all the more relevant in finite-size systems with weak dissipation. We run numerical simulations in three dimensions and find a crossover between the exponents z=3/2 and z=2 in the critical slowdown of the system, confirming the renormalization group results. From the biophysical point of view, our calculation indicates that in finite-size biological groups mode coupling terms in the equation of motion can significantly change the dynamical critical exponents even in the presence of dissipation, a step toward reconciling theory with experiments in natural swarms. Moreover, our result provides the scale within which fully conservative Bose-Einstein condensation is a good approximation in systems with weak symmetry-breaking terms violating number conservation, as quantum magnets or photon gases.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of biomolecules is the key to understanding their biological activities. Computational methods ranging from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to coarse-grained normal-mode analyses based on simplified elastic networks provide a general framework to studying these dynamics. Despite recent successes in studying very large systems with up to a 100,000,000 atoms, those methods are currently limited to studying small- to medium-sized molecular systems due to computational limitations. One solution to circumvent these limitations is to reduce the size of the system under study. In this paper, we argue that coarse-graining, the standard approach to such size reduction, must define a hierarchy of models of decreasing sizes that are consistent with each other, i.e., that each model contains the information of the dynamics of its predecessor. We propose a new method, Decimate, for generating such a hierarchy within the context of elastic networks for normal-mode analysis. This method is based on the concept of the renormalization group developed in statistical physics. We highlight the details of its implementation, with a special focus on its scalability to large systems of up to millions of atoms. We illustrate its application on two large systems, the capsid of a virus and the ribosome translation complex. We show that highly decimated representations of those systems, containing down to 1\% of their original number of atoms, still capture qualitatively and quantitatively their dynamics. Decimate is available as an {OpenSource} resource.},

Tracking mutant clones with a tunable fitness effect in bacterial colonies grown on randomly patterned surfaces we found that environmental heterogeneity can dramatically reduce the efficacy of selection. Time-lapse microscopy and computer simulations suggest that this effect arises generically from a local 'pinning’ of the expansion front, whereby stretches of the front are slowed down on a length scale that depends on the structure of the environmental heterogeneity. This pinning focuses the range expansion into a small number of 'lucky’ individuals with access to expansion paths, altering the neutral evolutionary dynamics and increasing the importance of chance relative to selection.},

	abstract = {Mutant evolution in fragmented populations has been studied extensively in evolutionary biology. With an increased focus on evolutionary dynamics in medical research, quantiﬁcation of mutant load in fragmented populations with varying levels of migration has become especially important. Examples of fragmented populations are hematopoietic stem cell niches in the bone marrow where cells can re-circulate between niches through the blood, or colonic crypts where movement of cells across diﬀerent crypts is not thought to be common. Here we use a combination of experiments and theory to investigate the role of migration in mutant distribution. In the case of neutral mutants, the experiments conﬁrmed that while the mean number of mutants is not inﬂuenced by migration, the probability distribution is, which manifested itself in a change in the skewedness of the distribution of the mutant numbers in the demes. In the case of disadvantageous mutants, we investigated the phenomenon of the increase in the expected number of mutants compared to that of the selection-mutation balance. In a single deme, this increase is observed when the deme size is lower than the critical size, Nc. In a fragmented system that consists of connected demes with a probability of migration, the increase in mutant numbers above the selection-mutation balance can be maintained in small (N {\textless} Nc) demes as long as the migration rate is suﬃciently small. The migration rate above which the mutants approach the selection-mutation balance decays exponentially with N/Nc. These ﬁndings are relevant in the context of the complex and poorly understood processes that may lead to changes in the clonal composition in tissues and tumors.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, predicting and even controlling evolutionary processes is a sought after goal in ﬁelds ranging from agriculture, artiﬁcial intelligence, astrobiology, oncology, and infectious diseases. However, our ability to predict evolution and plan such interventions in real populations is limited in part by our understanding of how spatial structure modulates evolutionary dynamics. Among current clinical assays applied to predict drug response in infectious diseases, for instance, many do not explicitly consider spatial structure and its inﬂuence on phenotypic heterogeneity, despite it being an inextricable characteristic of real populations. As spatially structured populations are subject to increased interference of beneﬁcial mutants compared to their well-mixed counter-parts, among other eﬀects, this population heterogeneity and structure may non-trivially impact drug response. In spatially-structured populations, the extent of this mutant interference is density dependent and thus varies with relative position within a meta-population in a manner modulated by mutant frequency, selection strength, migration speed, and habitat length, among other factors. In this study, we examine beneﬁcial mutant ﬁxation dynamics along the front of an asexual population expanding its range. We observe that multiple distinct evolutionary regimes of beneﬁcial mutant origin-ﬁxation dynamics are maintained at characteristic length scales along the front of the population expansion. Using an agent-based simulation of range expansion with mutation and selection in one dimension, we measure these length scales across a range of population sizes, selection strengths, and mutation rates. Furthermore, using simple scaling arguments to adapt theory from well-mixed populations, we ﬁnd that the length scale at the tip of the front within which ‘local’ mutant ﬁxation occurs in a successive mode decreases with increasing mutation rate, as well as population size in a manner predicted by our derived analytic expression. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our ﬁndings to real cellular populations, arguing that this conserved region of successive mutant ﬁxation dynamics at the wave tip can be exploited by emerging evolutionary control strategies.},

Then we compare the tumor sensitivity and progression in each of these groups of patients, and observe diﬀerences in the patterns of tumor growth between the groups. For instance, in tumors with a smaller density of naive macrophages than activated macrophages, a higher activation rate of macrophages leads to an increase in cancer cell density, demonstrating a negative eﬀect of macrophages. Other tumors however, exhibit an opposite trend, showing a positive eﬀect of macrophages in controlling tumor size. Although the results indicate that for all patients, the size of the tumor is sensitive to the parameters related to macrophages such as their activation and death rate, this research demonstrates that no single biomarker could predict the dynamics of tumors.},

	abstract = {Objective
The crypt population in the human intestine is dynamic: crypts can divide to produce two new daughter crypts through a process termed crypt fission, but whether this is balanced by a second process to remove crypts, as recently shown in mouse models, is uncertain. We examined whether crypt fusion (the process of two neighbouring crypts fusing into a single daughter crypt) occurs in the human colon.

Design
We used somatic alterations in the gene cytochrome c oxidase ({CCO}) as lineage tracing markers to assess the clonality of bifurcating colon crypts (n=309 bifurcating crypts from 13 patients). Mathematical modelling was used to determine whether the existence of crypt fusion can explain the experimental data, and how the process of fusion influences the rate of crypt fission.

Results
In 55\% (21/38) of bifurcating crypts in which clonality could be assessed, we observed perfect segregation of clonal lineages to the respective crypt arms. Mathematical modelling showed that this frequency of perfect segregation could not be explained by fission alone (p{\textless}10−20). With the rates of fission and fusion taken to be approximately equal, we then used the distribution of {CCO}-deficient patch size to estimate the rate of crypt fission, finding a value of around 0.011 divisions/crypt/year.

Conclusions
We have provided the evidence that human colonic crypts undergo fusion, a potential homeostatic process to regulate total crypt number. The existence of crypt fusion in the human colon adds a new facet to our understanding of the highly dynamic and plastic phenotype of the colonic epithelium.},

	abstract = {Feedback mechanisms within cell lineages are thought to be important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mathematical models that assume well-mixed cell populations, together with experimental data, have suggested that negative feedback from differentiated cells on the stem cell self-renewal probability can maintain a stable equilibrium and hence homeostasis. Cell lineage dynamics, however, are characterized by spatial structure, which can lead to different properties. Here, we investigate these dynamics using spatially explicit computational models, including cell division, differentiation, death, and migration / diffusion processes. According to these models, the negative feedback loop on stem cell self-renewal fails to maintain homeostasis, both under the assumption of strong spatial restrictions and fast migration / diffusion. Although homeostasis cannot be maintained, this feedback can regulate cell density and promote the formation of spatial structures in the model. Tissue homeostasis, however, can be achieved if spatially restricted negative feedback on self-renewal is combined with an experimentally documented spatial feedforward loop, in which stem cells regulate the fate of transit amplifying cells. This indicates that the dynamics of feedback regulation in tissue cell lineages are more complex than previously thought, and that combinations of spatially explicit control mechanisms are likely instrumental.},

            The footprint left by early cancer dynamics on the spatial arrangement of tumour cells is poorly understood, and yet could encode information about how therapy resistant sub-clones grew within the expanding tumour. Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population mixing. First, using a toy model of cell mixing we demonstrate how first passage time statistics can distinguish between different pattern structures. We then apply our method to simulated patterns of wild-type and mutated tumour cell population mixing, generated using an agent-based model of expanding tumours, to explore how first passage times reflect mutant cell replicative advantage, time of emergence and strength of cell pushing. Finally, we analyse experimentally measured patterns of genetic point mutations in human colorectal cancer, and estimate parameters of early sub-clonal dynamics using our spatial computational model. We uncover a wide range of mutant cell replicative advantages and timings, with the majority of sampled tumours consistent with boundary driven growth or short-range cell pushing. By analysing multiple sub-sampled regions in a small number of samples, we explore how the distribution of inferred dynamics could inform about the initial mutational event. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of first passage time analysis as a new methodology for quantifying cell mixing patterns
            in vivo
            , and suggest that patterns of sub-clonal mixing can provide insights into early cancer dynamics.},

	abstract = {Geographic coincidence of animal and plant distributions to form recognizable patterns suggests that the separate components of the patterns are historically connected with each other and with geographic history. To seek evidence of these historical connections, cladograms of geographic areas, representing sequences of disruptive geologic, climatic, or geographic events, may be compared with biological cladograms, representing sequences of allopatric speciation events in relation to those geographic areas. Such comparisons, when they meet the minimum requirements of being among dichotomized three-taxon cladograms, can resolve similar or dissimilar historical factors; two-taxon statements do not distinguish between groups with different histories. Congruence of biological and geological area-cladograms at a high confidence level (such as congruence of a five-taxon cladogram or four three-taxon cladograms with a geological cladogram, where the confidence level can be shown in cladistic theory to be 99\%) means that specified events of paleogeography can be adopted as an explanation of the biological patterns. In such a cause and effect relationship, where the earth and its life are assumed to have evolved together, paleogeography is taken by logical necessity to be the independent variable and biological history, the dependent variable. Drawing a mathematical simile, the biological cladogram y (dependent variable), is a function of the geological cladogram x (independent variable), as in a simple regression of effect y on cause x where we are given no free choice as to which is the independent variable. Such a view implies that any specified sequence in earth history must coincide with some discoverable biological patterns; it does not imply a necessary converse that each biological pattern must coincide with some discoverable paleogeographic pattern, because some biological distributions might have resulted from stochastic processes (chance dispersal). Determining that all discoverable biological patterns conflict with a given corroborated or observed sequence of geologic, climatic, or geographic change (i.e., that y is not a function of x), in theory, therefore should falsify vicariance biogeography. Because dispersal biogeography presupposes stochastic processes, and any failure to meet the expectation of a postulated dispersal is explained by an additional dispersal, dispersal biogeography is immune to falsification. Without resort to paleontology or earth history, whether a given historical relationship implied by congruence of biological area-cladograms is the result of dispersal or vicariance can also be thought of in terms which minimize the number of necessary assumptions: did the sedentary organisms disperse with the vagile ones or did the vagile organisms vicariate with the sedentary ones? Cladistic congruence of a group of sedentary organisms with a group of vagile ones rejects dispersal for both. Hence, distributions of sedentary organisms have the potential to falsify dispersal theories as applied to vagile organisms, but distributions of vagile organisms cannot falsify vicariance theories as applied to sedentary ones. The problems that arise in various kinds of historical explanation are exemplified by several specific distributions of fishes and other organisms in North and Middle America and in the larger context of Pangaean history, and are discussed in relation to current species concepts.},

Colorectal cancers derive from colonic crypt epithelia but, in contrast, form morphologically disarrayed glands. In this study, we investigated to which extent colorectal cancers phenocopy colonic crypt architecture and thus preserve structural organization of the normal intestinal epithelium. A subset of colon cancers showed crypt-like compartments with high {WNT} activity and nuclear β-Catenin at the leading tumor edge, adjacent proliferation, and enhanced Cytokeratin 20 expression in most differentiated tumor epithelia of the tumor center. This architecture strongly depended on growth conditions, and was fully reproducible in mouse xenografts of cultured and primary colon cancer cells. Full crypt-like organization was associated with low tumor grade and was an independent prognostic marker of better survival in a collection of 221 colorectal cancers. Our findings suggest that full activation of preserved intestinal morphogenetic programs in colon cancer requires in vivo growth environments. Furthermore, crypt-like architecture was linked with less aggressive tumor biology, and may be useful to improve current colon cancer grading schemes.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary theories are critical for understanding cancer development at the level of species as well as at the level of cells and tissues, and for developing effective therapies. Animals have evolved potent tumor suppressive mechanisms to prevent cancer development. These mechanisms were initially necessary for the evolution of multi-cellular organisms, and became even more important as animals evolved large bodies and long lives. Indeed, the development and architecture of our tissues were evolutionarily constrained by the need to limit cancer. Cancer development within an individual is also an evolutionary process, which in many respects mirrors species evolution. Species evolve by mutation and selection acting on individuals in a population; tumors evolve by mutation and selection acting on cells in a tissue. The processes of mutation and selection are integral to the evolution of cancer at every step of multistage carcinogenesis, from tumor genesis to metastasis. Factors associated with cancer development, such as aging and carcinogens, have been shown to promote cancer evolution by impacting both mutation and selection processes. While there are therapies that can decimate a cancer cell population, unfortunately, cancers can also evolve resistance to these therapies, leading to the resurgence of treatment-refractory disease. Understanding cancer from an evolutionary perspective can allow us to appreciate better why cancers predominantly occur in the elderly, and why other conditions, from radiation exposure to smoking, are associated with increased cancers. Importantly, the application of evolutionary theory to cancer should engender new treatment strategies that could better control this dreaded disease.},

	abstract = {{CpG} islands ({CGIs}) are vertebrate genomic landmarks that encompass the promoters of most genes and often lack {DNA} methylation. Querying their apparent importance, the number of {CGIs} is reported to vary widely in different species and many do not co-localise with annotated promoters. We set out to quantify the number of {CGIs} in mouse and human genomes using {CXXC} Affinity Purification plus deep sequencing ({CAP}-seq). We also asked whether {CGIs} not associated with annotated transcripts share properties with those at known promoters. We found that, contrary to previous estimates, {CGI} abundance in humans and mice is very similar and many are at conserved locations relative to genes. In each species {CpG} density correlates positively with the degree of H3K4 trimethylation, supporting the hypothesis that these two properties are mechanistically interdependent. Approximately half of mammalian {CGIs} ({\textgreater}10,000) are “orphans” that are not associated with annotated promoters. Many orphan {CGIs} show evidence of transcriptional initiation and dynamic expression during development. Unlike {CGIs} at known promoters, orphan {CGIs} are frequently subject to {DNA} methylation during development, and this is accompanied by loss of their active promoter features. In colorectal tumors, however, orphan {CGIs} are not preferentially methylated, suggesting that cancer does not recapitulate a developmental program. Human and mouse genomes have similar numbers of {CGIs}, over half of which are remote from known promoters. Orphan {CGIs} nevertheless have the characteristics of functional promoters, though they are much more likely than promoter {CGIs} to become methylated during development and hence lose these properties. The data indicate that orphan {CGIs} correspond to previously undetected promoters whose transcriptional activity may play a functional role during development., In the decade since the sequence of the human genome was announced, efforts have been made to annotate all genes with their regulatory sequences. {CpG} islands are short regions containing the sequence {CG} at high density that map to regions controlling the expression of most human genes (known as promoters). Using a biochemical method, we have identified and mapped all {CpG} islands in the human and mouse genomes and find that over half are remote from known gene promoters—so-called “orphans.” Mice, which were thought to possess far fewer {CpG} islands than humans, turn out to have a very similar number. Surprisingly, orphan {CpG} islands in both species often mark hitherto unknown promoters. The activity of these novel promoters is particularly dynamic during normal development, as they are often silenced by {DNA} methylation. In colorectal cancers, however, aberrant {DNA} methylation affects all {CpG} islands equally.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Conservation is broadly used to identify biologically important (epi)genomic regions. In the case of tumor growth, preferential conservation of {DNA} methylation can be used to identify areas of particular functional importance to the tumor. However, reliable assessment of methylation conservation based on multiple tissue samples per patient requires the decomposition of methylation variation at multiple levels.

Results
We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows for variance decomposition of methylation on three levels: between-patient normal tissue variation, between-patient tumor-effect variation and within-patient tumor variation. We then defined a model-based conservation score to identify loci of reduced within-tumor methylation variation relative to between-patient variation. We fit the model to multi-sample methylation array data from 21 colorectal cancer ({CRC}) patients using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm (Stan). Sets of genes implicated in {CRC} tumorigenesis exhibited preferential conservation, demonstrating the model’s ability to identify functionally relevant genes based on methylation conservation. A pathway analysis of preferentially conserved genes implicated several {CRC} relevant pathways and pathways related to neoantigen presentation and immune evasion. Our findings suggest that preferential methylation conservation may be used to identify novel gene targets that are not consistently mutated in {CRC}. The flexible structure makes the model amenable to the analysis of more complex multi-sample data structures.

	abstract = {The dynamical process of cell division that underpins homeostasis in the human body cannot be directly observed in vivo, but instead is measurable from the pattern of somatic genetic or epigenetic mutations that accrue in tissues over an individual's lifetime. Because somatic mutations are heritable, they serve as natural lineage tracing markers that delineate clonal expansions. Mathematical analysis of the distribution of somatic clone sizes gives a quantitative readout of the rates of cell birth, death, and replacement. In this review we explore the broad range of somatic mutation types that have been used for lineage tracing in human tissues, introduce the mathematical concepts used to infer dynamical information from these clone size data, and discuss the insights of this lineage tracing approach for our understanding of homeostasis and cancer development. We use the human colon as a particularly instructive exemplar tissue. There is a rich history of human somatic cell dynamics surreptitiously written into the cell genomes that is being uncovered by advances in sequencing and careful mathematical analysis lineage of tracing data. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Spatial properties of tumour growth have profound implications for cancer progression, therapeutic resistance and metastasis. Yet, how spatial position governs tumour cell division remains difficult to evaluate in clinical tumours. Here, we demonstrate that faster division on the tumour periphery leaves characteristic genetic patterns, which become evident when a phylogenetic tree is reconstructed from spatially sampled cells. Namely, rapidly dividing peripheral lineages branch more extensively and acquire more mutations than slower-dividing centre lineages. We develop a Bayesian state-dependent evolutionary phylodynamic model ({SDevo}) that quantifies these patterns to infer the differential division rates between peripheral and central cells. We demonstrate that this approach accurately infers spatially varying birth rates of simulated tumours across a range of growth conditions and sampling strategies. We then show that {SDevo} outperforms state-of-the-art, non-cancer multi-state phylodynamic methods that ignore differential sequence evolution. Finally, we apply {SDevo} to single-time-point, multi-region sequencing data from clinical hepatocellular carcinomas and find evidence of a three- to six-times-higher division rate on the tumour edge. With the increasing availability of high-resolution, multi-region sequencing, we anticipate that {SDevo} will be useful in interrogating spatial growth restrictions and could be extended to model non-spatial factors that influence tumour progression.},

In Model A, drift and selection process preserves expected fitness whereas in Model B it leads to non-decreasing expected fitness. We investigate these properties using mathematical analysis and extensive simulations, which detect the effect of the so-called drift barrier in Model B but not in Model A. These effects are reflected in different structure of clone genealogies in the two models. Our work is related to the past theoretical work in the field of evolutionary genetics, concerning the interplay among mutation, drift and selection, in absence of recombination (asexual reproduction), where epistasis plays a major role. Finally, we use the statistics of mutation frequencies known as the Site Frequency Spectra ({SFS}), to compare the variant frequencies in {DNA} of sequenced {HER}2+ breast cancers, to those based on Model A and B simulations. The tumor-based {SFS} are better reproduced by Model A, pointing out a possible selection pattern of {HER}2+ tumor evolution. To put our models in context, we carried out an exploratory study of how publicly accessible data from breast, prostate, skin and ovarian cancers fit a range of models found in the literature.},

This evolutionary history, which takes the shape of a tree, reveals the mode of evolution of the specific cancer under study and, in turn, helps with clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic treatment. In this study we focus on the question of determining the mode of evolution of tumor cells from their inferred evolutionary history. In particular, we employ recursive neural networks that capture tree structures to classify the evolutionary history of tumor cells into one of four modes—linear, branching, neutral, and punctuated. We trained our model, {MoTERNN}, using simulated data in a supervised fashion and applied it to a real phylogenetic tree obtained from single-cell {DNA} sequencing data. {MoTERNN} is implemented in Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/{NakhlehLab}/{MoTERNN}.},

	abstract = {The natural history of cancers can be understood through the lens of evolution given that the driving forces of cancer development are mutation and selection of fitter clones. Cancer growth and progression are spatial processes that involve the breakdown of normal tissue organization, invasion and metastasis. For these reasons, spatial patterns are an integral part of histological tumour grading and staging as they measure the progression from normal to malignant disease. Furthermore, tumour cells are part of an ecosystem of tumour cells and their surrounding tumour microenvironment. A range of new spatial genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies offers new avenues for the study of cancer evolution with great molecular and spatial detail. These methods enable precise characterizations of the tumour microenvironment, cellular interactions therein and micro-anatomical structures. In conjunction with spatial genomics, it emerges that tumours and microenvironments co-evolve, which helps explain observable patterns of heterogeneity and offers new routes for therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Cancer growth can be described as a caricature of the renewal process of the tissue of origin, where the tissue architecture has a strong influence on the evolutionary dynamics within the tumor. Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity: competition for space. Time-varying competition leads to an emergent transition from Darwinian premalignant growth to subsequent invasive neutral tumor growth. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (Darwinian to neutral) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects. Driver acquisition during the Darwinian precancerous stage may be modulated en route to neutral evolution by the combination of two factors: spatial constraints and limited cellular mixing. These two factors occur naturally in ductal carcinomas, where the branching topology of the ductal network dictates spatial constraints and mixing rates.},

Hence, the optimum fitness landscape between A and B is given by an exponential function. Our result is precise for small mutation rates and excluding back mutations.

	abstract = {We investigated the means and timing by which mutations become fixed in the human colonic epithelium by visualizing somatic clones and mathematical inference. Fixation requires two sequential steps. First, one of approximately seven active stem cells residing within each colonic crypt has to be mutated. Second, the mutated stem cell has to replace neighbors to populate the entire crypt in a process that takes several years. Subsequent clonal expansion due to crypt fission is infrequent for neutral mutations (around 0.7\% of all crypts undergo fission in a single year). Pro-oncogenic mutations subvert both stem cell replacement to accelerate fixation and clonal expansion by crypt fission to achieve high mutant allele frequencies with age. The benchmarking of these behaviors allows the advantage associated with different gene-specific mutations to be compared irrespective of the cellular mechanisms by which they are conferred.,

	abstract = {The comparison and categorization of tree diagrams is fundamental to large parts of biology, linguistics, computer science, and other fields, yet the indices currently applied to describing tree shape have important flaws that complicate their interpretation and limit their scope. Here we introduce a new system of indices with no such shortcomings. Our indices account for node sizes and branch lengths and are robust to small changes in either attribute. Unlike currently popular phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic entropy, and tree balance indices, our definitions assign interpretable values to all rooted trees and enable meaningful comparison of any pair of trees. Our self-consistent definitions further unite measures of diversity, richness, balance, symmetry, effective height, effective outdegree, and effective branch count in a coherent system, and we derive numerous simple relationships between these indices. The main practical advantages of our indices are in 1) quantifying diversity in non-ultrametric trees; 2) assessing the balance of trees that have non-uniform branch lengths or node sizes; 3) comparing the balance of trees with different leaf counts or outdegrees; 4) obtaining a coherent, generic, multidimensional quantification of tree shape that is robust to sampling error and inferential error. We illustrate these features by comparing the shapes of trees representing the evolution of {HIV} and of Uralic languages. Given the ubiquity of tree structures, we identify a wide range of applications across diverse domains.},

A binary search tree T for a set of keys from a total order is a binary tree in which each node has a key value and all the keys of the left subtree are less than the key at the root and all the keys of the right subtree are greater than the key at the root, this property holding recursively for the left and right subtrees of the tree T. Suppose we are given n keys and the probabilities of accessing each key and those occurring in the gap between two successive keys. The optimal binary search tree problem is to construct a binary search tree on these n keys that minimizes the expected access time. One variant of this problem is when only the gaps have nonzero access probabilities, and is called the optimal alphabetic tree problem. Another related problem is when there is no order between the keys and there are probabilities associated only with the gaps and the objective is to build a binary tree with minimum expected weighted path length from the root. This is called the Huffman tree problem. In this survey, we assess known results on the structural properties of the optimal trees, algorithms and lower bounds to construct and to verify optimal trees and heuristics to construct nearly optimal trees and other related results.},

Here, we start filling this gap by investigating the statistical properties of the cell lineages generated by the two dimensional Eden model, leveraging their physical analogy with directed polymers. Our analysis provides quantitative estimates for population measurements that can easily be assessed via sequencing, such as the average number of segregating sites and the clone size distribution of a subsample of the population. Our results not only reveal remarkable features of the genealogies generated during growth, but also highlight new properties that can be misinterpreted as signs of selection if non-spatial models are inappropriately applied.},

            Balance indices that quantify the symmetry of branching events and the compactness of trees are widely used to compare evolutionary processes or tree-generating algorithms. Yet, existing indices are not defined for all rooted trees, are unreliable for comparing trees with different numbers of leaves, and are sensitive to the presence or absence of rare types. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, we define a new class of robust, universal tree balance indices. These indices take a form similar to Colless’ index but can account for population sizes, are defined for trees with any degree distribution, and enable meaningful comparison of trees with different numbers of leaves. Second, we show that for bifurcating and all other full m-ary cladograms (in which every internal node has the same out-degree), one such Colless-like index is equivalent to the normalized reciprocal of Sackin’s index. Hence, we both unify and generalize the two most popular existing tree balance indices. Our indices are intrinsically normalized and can be computed in linear time. We conclude that these more widely applicable indices have the potential to supersede those in current use. [Cancer; clone tree; Colless index; Sackin index; species tree; tree balance.]},

	abstract = {Mutation accumulation in tumour evolution is one major cause of intra-tumour heterogeneity ({ITH}), which often leads to drug resistance during treatment. Previous studies with multi-region sequencing have shown that mutation divergence among samples within the patient is common, and the importance of spatial sampling to obtain a complete picture in tumour measurements. However, quantitative comparisons of the relationship between mutation heterogeneity and tumour expansion modes, sampling distances as well as the sampling methods are still few. Here, we investigate how mutations diverge over space by varying the sampling distance and tumour expansion modes using individual-based simulations. We measure {ITH} by the Jaccard index between samples and quantify how {ITH} increases with sampling distance, the pattern of which holds in various sampling methods and sizes. We also compare the inferred mutation rates based on the distributions of variant allele frequencies under different tumour expansion modes and sampling sizes. In exponentially fast expanding tumours, a mutation rate can always be inferred for any sampling size. However, the accuracy compared with the true value decreases when the sampling size decreases, where small sampling sizes result in a high estimate of the mutation rate. In addition, such an inference becomes unreliable when the tumour expansion is slow, such as in surface growth.},

Here, we develop a new methodology called {EVOFLUx}, based upon natural {DNA} methylation barcodes fluctuating over time, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply {EVOFLUx} to 1,976 well-characterised lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that tumour growth rates, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe that tumour growth rates are higher in more aggressive disease subtypes, and in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients, evolutionary histories are independent prognostic factors. Phylogenetic analyses of longitudinal {CLL} samples using {EVOFLUx} detect the seeds of future Richter transformation many decades prior to presentation. We provide orthogonal verification of {EVOFLUx} inferences using additional genetic and clinical data. Collectively, we show how widely-available, low-cost bulk {DNA} methylation data precisely measures cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.},

Subclonal reconstruction methods based on machine learning aim to separate those subpopulations in a sample and infer their evolutionary history. However, current approaches are entirely data driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in the analysis if evolution is not accounted for, and this is exacerbated with multi-sampling of the same tumor. We present a novel approach for model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction, called {MOBSTER}, which combines machine learning with theoretical population genetics. Using public whole-genome sequencing data from 2,606 samples from different cohorts, new data and synthetic validation, we show that this method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in single-sample, multiregion and longitudinal data. This approach minimizes the confounding factors of nonevolutionary methods, thus leading to more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human cancers.},

Here we use {DNA} barcoding to track murine mammary cancer cell clones during immunoediting and determine clonal transcriptional profiles that allow immune evasion following anti-{PD}1 plus anti-{CTLA}4 immunotherapy. Clonal diversity is significantly restricted by immunotherapy treatment in both primary tumours and metastases, demonstrating selection for pre-existing breast cancer cell populations and ongoing immunoediting during metastasis and treatment. Immunotherapy resistant clones express a common gene signature associated with poor survival of basal-like breast cancer patient cohorts. At least one of these genes has an existing small molecule that can potentially be used to improve immunotherapy response.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about the clonal evolution of a tumor can help to interpret the function of its genetic alterations by identifying initiating events and events that contribute to the selective advantage of proliferative, metastatic, and drug-resistant subclones. Clonal evolution can be reconstructed from estimates of the relative abundance (frequency) of subclone-specific alterations in tumor biopsies, which, in turn, inform on its composition. However, estimating these frequencies is complicated by the high genetic instability that characterizes many cancers. Models for genetic instability suggest that copy number alterations ({CNAs}) can influence mutation-frequency estimates and thus impede efforts to reconstruct tumor phylogenies. Our analysis suggested that accurate mutation frequency estimates require accounting for {CNAs}—a challenging endeavour using the genetic profile of a single tumor biopsy. Instead, we propose an optimization algorithm, Chimæra, to account for the effects of {CNAs} using profiles of multiple biopsies per tumor. Analyses of simulated data and tumor profiles suggested that Chimæra estimates are consistently more accurate than those of previously proposed methods and resulted in improved phylogeny reconstructions and subclone characterizations. Our analyses inferred recurrent initiating mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas, resolved the clonal composition of Wilms’ tumors, and characterized the acquisition of mutations in drug-resistant prostate cancers.},

We infer the selection coefficients for three breast cancer samples, resulting in good fits of the shape of their Site Frequency Spectra. All fitted values for the selective disadvantage of passenger mutations are nonzero, supporting the view that they exert deleterious selection during tumorigenesis that driver mutations must compensate.},

We conducted a systematic review of English medical literature to identify studies reporting {LRF} rates, over time, following surgery alone for breast, lung, or colorectal cancer. Patients who received radiation/hormones/chemotherapy were excluded since these therapies may alter tumor growth kinetics after surgery. For each disease, data were considered in three ways: 1) absolute cumulative {LRF} rate over time; 2) percentage of {LRFs} manifest over time (to facilitate comparisons between studies with different absolute magnitudes of {LRFs}); and 3) weighted average of the percentage of {LRFs} manifest over time. For breast cancer (based on data from 3043 patients from 5 studies), we found that the median time to {LRF} was 2.7 years. For lung cancer (based on data from 1190 patients from 4 studies), the median time to {LRF} was 1.5 years. For rectal cancer (based on data from 3334 patients from 10 studies), the median time to {LRF} was 1.5 years.

Warlock encapsulates a deme-based oncology model (demon), designed to bridge the divide between agent-based simulations and analytical population genetics models, such as the spatial Moran process. Model output can be readily compared to multi-region and single-cell sequencing data for model selection or biological parameter inference. An interface for High Performance Computing permits hundreds of simulations to be run in parallel. We discuss prior applications of this workflow to investigating human cancer evolution.},

Stressing the importance of tailoring the model structure to that of the biological system, we describe methods of increasing complexity, from the basic Eden growth model up to off-lattice simulations with diffusible factors. We examine choices that unavoidably arise in model design, such as implementation, parameterisation, visualisation, and reproducibility. Each topic is illustrated with examples drawn from recent research studies and state of the art modelling platforms.

	abstract = {We introduce a new spatial statistic, the weighted pair correlation function ({wPCF}). The {wPCF} extends the existing pair correlation function ({PCF}) and cross-{PCF} to describe spatial relationships between points marked with combinations of discrete and continuous labels. We validate its use through application to a new agent-based model ({ABM}) which simulates interactions between macrophages and tumour cells. These interactions are influenced by the spatial positions of the cells and by macrophage phenotype, a continuous variable that ranges from anti-tumour to pro-tumour. By varying model parameters that regulate macrophage phenotype, we show that the {ABM} exhibits behaviours which resemble the ‘three Es of cancer immunoediting’: Equilibrium, Escape, and Elimination. We use the {wPCF} to analyse synthetic images generated by the {ABM}. We show that the {wPCF} generates a ‘human readable’ statistical summary of where macrophages with different phenotypes are located relative to both blood vessels and tumour cells. We also define a distinct ‘{PCF} signature’ that characterises each of the three Es of immunoediting, by combining {wPCF} measurements with the cross-{PCF} describing interactions between vessels and tumour cells. By applying dimension reduction techniques to this signature, we identify its key features and train a support vector machine classifier to distinguish between simulation outputs based on their {PCF} signature. This proof-of-concept study shows how multiple spatial statistics can be combined to analyse the complex spatial features that the {ABM} generates, and to partition them into interpretable groups. The intricate spatial features produced by the {ABM} are similar to those generated by state-of-the-art multiplex imaging techniques which distinguish the spatial distribution and intensity of multiple biomarkers in biological tissue regions. Applying methods such as the {wPCF} to multiplex imaging data would exploit the continuous variation in biomarker intensities and generate more detailed characterisation of the spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity in tissue samples.},

	abstract = {Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). {PhysiCell}—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility “out of the box.” The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. {PhysiCell} has been parallelized with {OpenMP}, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single {HPC} compute nodes. We demonstrate {PhysiCell} by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ ({DCIS}) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of {PhysiCell} with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a “cellular cargo delivery” system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. {PhysiCell} is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The {PhysiCell} source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the {BSD} license at http://{PhysiCell}.{MathCancer}.org and http://{PhysiCell}.sf.net.},

These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population.

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. {ABC} methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, {ABC} methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. {ABC} methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of {ABC} exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. {ABC} has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature.},

	abstract = {Solid tumour growth depends on a host of factors which affect the cell life cycle and extracellular matrix vascularization that leads to a favourable environment. The whole solid tumour can either grow or wither in response to the action of the immune system and therapeutics. A personalised mathematical model of such behaviour must consider both the intra- and inter-cellular dynamics and the mechanics of the solid tumour and its microenvironment. However, such wide range of spatial and temporal scales can hardly be modelled in a single model, and require the so-called multiscale models, defined as orchestrations of single-scale component models, connected by relation models that transform the data for one scale to another. While multiscale models are becoming common, there is a well-established engineering approach to the definition of the scale separation, e.g., how the spatiotemporal continuum is split in the various component models. In most studies scale separation is defined as natural, linked to anatomical concepts such as organ, tissue, or cell; but these do not provide reliable definition of scales: for examples skeletal organs can be as large as 500 mm (femur), or as small as 3 mm (stapes). Here we apply a recently proposed scale-separation approach based on the actual experimental and computational limitations to a patient-specific model of the growth of neuroblastoma. The resulting multiscale model can be properly informed with the available experimental data and solved in a reasonable timeframe with the available computational resources.},

These formulae are applied to estimate the base substitution rates at the first, second, and third positions of codons in genes for presomatotropins, preproinsulins, and alpha- and beta-globins (using comparisons involving mammals). Also, formulae for estimating the synonymous component (at the third codon position) and the standard errors are obtained. It is pointed out that the rates of synonymous base substitutions not only are very high but also are roughly equal to each other between genes even when amino acid-altering substitution rates are quite different and that this is consistent with the neutral mutation-random drift hypothesis of molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {Substantial evidence supports the concept that cancers are organized in a cellular hierarchy with cancer stem cells ({CSC}) at the apex. To date, the primary evidence for {CSCs} derives from transplantation assays, which have known limitations. In particular, they are unable to report on the fate of cells within the original human tumor. Because of the difficulty in measuring tumor characteristics in patients, cellular organization and other aspects of cancer dynamics have not been quantified directly, although they likely play a fundamental role in tumor progression and therapy response. As such, new approaches to study {CSCs} in patient-derived tumor specimens are needed. In this study, we exploited ultradeep single-molecule genomic data derived from multiple microdissected colorectal cancer glands per tumor, along with a novel quantitative approach to measure tumor characteristics, define patient-specific tumor profiles, and infer tumor ancestral trees. We show that each cancer is unique in terms of its cellular organization, molecular heterogeneity, time from malignant transformation, and rate of mutation and apoptosis. Importantly, we estimate {CSC} fractions between 0.5\% and 4\%, indicative of a hierarchical organization responsible for long-lived {CSC} lineages, with variable rates of symmetric cell division. We also observed extensive molecular heterogeneity, both between and within individual cancer glands, suggesting a complex hierarchy of mitotic clones. Our framework enables the measurement of clinically relevant patient-specific characteristics in vivo, providing insight into the cellular organization and dynamics of tumor growth, with implications for personalized patient care.},

Much of the modeling work has been based on classical models of population genetics, generalized to accommodate time-varying cell population size. Reverse-time, genealogical views of such models, commonly known as coalescents, have been used to infer aspects of the past of growing populations. Another approach is to use branching processes, the simplest scenario being the classical linear birth-death process. Inference from evolutionary models of {DNA} often exploits summary statistics of the sequence data, a common one being the so-called Site Frequency Spectrum ({SFS}). In a bulk tumor sequencing experiment, we can estimate for each site at which a novel somatic point mutation has arisen, the proportion of cells that carry that mutation. These numbers are then grouped into collections of sites which have similar mutant fractions. We examine how the {SFS} based on birth-death processes differs from those based on the coalescent model. This may stem from the different sampling mechanisms in the two approaches. However, we also show that despite this, they are quantitatively comparable for the range of parameters typical for tumor cell populations. We also present a model of tumor evolution with selective sweeps, and demonstrate how it may help in understanding the history of a tumor as well as the influence of data pre-processing. We illustrate the theory with applications to several examples from The Cancer Genome Atlas tumors.},

This conclusion has been criticized based on data quality issues, statistical considerations, and simulation results. Here, we use rigorous mathematical arguments to investigate the site frequency spectrum in the two-type model of clonal evolution. If the fitnesses of the two types are λ0 {\textless} λ1, then the site frequency spectrum is c/fα where α = λ0/λ1. This is due to the advantageous mutations that produce the founders of the type 1 population. Mutations within the growing type 0 and type 1 populations follow the 1/f law. Our results show that, in contrast to published criticisms, neutral evolution in an exponentially growing tumor can be distinguished from the two-type model using the site frequency spectrum.},

Typically weights are chosen at the start of the algorithm which normalise the summary statistics to vary on similar scales. However these may not be appropriate in iterative {ABC} algorithms, where the distribution from which the parameters are proposed is updated. This can substantially alter the resulting distribution of summary statistics, so that different weights are needed for normalisation.

In this article we provide a comprehensive review and comparison of the performance of the principal methods of dimension reduction proposed in the {ABC} literature. The methods are split into three nonmutually exclusive classes consisting of best subset selection methods, projection techniques and regularization. In addition, we introduce two new methods of dimension reduction. The first is a best subset selection method based on Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, and the second uses ridge regression as a regularization procedure. We illustrate the performance of these dimension reduction techniques through the analysis of three challenging models and data sets.},

The validity of this assumption has never been quantitatively assessed. We developed a rigorous statistical framework to test the infinite sites assumption with single-cell sequencing data. Our framework accounts for the high noise and contamination present in such data. We found strong evidence for the same genomic position being mutationally affected multiple times in individual tumors for 11 of 12 single-cell sequencing data sets from a variety of human cancers. Seven cases involved the loss of earlier mutations, five of which occurred at sites unaffected by large-scale genomic deletions. Four cases exhibited a parallel mutation, potentially indicating convergent evolution at the base pair level. Our results refute the general validity of the infinite sites assumption and indicate that more complex models are needed to adequately quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity for more effective cancer treatment.},

A generalized least-squares method was applied in fitting a model to {mtDNA} sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that {mtDNA} was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

This broad term encompasses many possible dynamic treatment protocols of patient-specific dose modulation or dose timing. Adaptive therapy maintains high levels of tumor burden to benefit from the competitive suppression of treatment-sensitive subpopulations on treatment-resistant subpopulations. This evolution-based approach to cancer treatment has been integrated into several ongoing or planned clinical trials, including treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and {BRAF}-mutant melanoma. In the previous few decades, experimental and clinical investigation of adaptive therapy has progressed synergistically with mathematical and computational modeling. In this work, we discuss 11 open questions in cancer adaptive therapy mathematical modeling. The questions are split into three sections: (1) integrating the appropriate components into mathematical models (2) design and validation of dosing protocols, and (3) challenges and opportunities in clinical translation.},

Genetic instability is usually caused by aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity. Mutations in the tumor suppressor or cell cycle genes may also lead to cellular transformation. Similarly, epigenetic and/or genetic alterations resulting in impaired cellular pathways, such as {DNA} repair mechanism, may lead to microsatellite instability and mutator phenotype. Non-coding {RNAs}, more importantly {microRNAs} and long non-coding {RNAs} have also been implicated at various {CRC} stages. Understanding the specific mechanisms of tumorigenesis and the underlying genetic and epigenetic traits is critical in comprehending the disease phenotype. This paper reviews these mechanisms along with the roles of various non-coding {RNAs} in {CRCs}.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0012002},
	abstract = {Exactly how human tumors grow is uncertain because serial observations are impractical. One approach to reconstruct the histories of individual human cancers is to analyze the current genomic variation between its cells. The greater the variations, on average, the greater the time since the last clonal evolution cycle ("a molecular clock hypothesis"). Here we analyze passenger {DNA} methylation patterns from opposite sides of 12 primary human colorectal cancers ({CRCs}) to evaluate whether the variation (pairwise distances between epialleles) is consistent with a single clonal expansion after transformation.
Data from 12 primary {CRCs} are compared to epigenomic data simulated under a single clonal expansion for a variety of possible growth scenarios. We find that for many different growth rates, a single clonal expansion can explain the population variation in 11 out of 12 {CRCs}. In eight {CRCs}, the cells from different glands are all equally distantly related, and cells sampled from the same tumor half appear no more closely related than cells sampled from opposite tumor halves. In these tumors, growth appears consistent with a single "symmetric" clonal expansion. In three {CRCs}, the variation in epigenetic distances was different between sides, but this asymmetry could be explained by a single clonal expansion with one region of a tumor having undergone more cell division than the other. The variation in one {CRC} was complex and inconsistent with a simple single clonal expansion.
Rather than a series of clonal expansion after transformation, these results suggest that the epigenetic variation of present-day cancer cells in primary {CRCs} can almost always be explained by a single clonal expansion.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0021657},
	abstract = {It is possible to infer the past of populations by comparing genomes between individuals. In general, older populations have more genomic diversity than younger populations. The force of selection can also be inferred from population diversity. If selection is strong and frequently eliminates less fit variants, diversity will be limited because new, initially homogeneous populations constantly emerge.
Here we translate a population genetics approach to human somatic cancer cell populations by measuring genomic diversity within and between small colorectal cancer ({CRC}) glands. Control tissue culture and xenograft experiments demonstrate that the population diversity of certain passenger {DNA} methylation patterns is reduced after cloning but subsequently increases with time. When measured in {CRC} gland populations, passenger methylation diversity from different parts of nine {CRCs} was relatively high and uniform, consistent with older, stable lineages rather than mixtures of younger homogeneous populations arising from frequent cycles of selection. The diversity of six metastases was also high, suggesting dissemination early after transformation. Diversity was lower in {DNA} mismatch repair deficient {CRC} glands, possibly suggesting more selection and the elimination of less fit variants when mutation rates are elevated.
The many hitchhiking passenger variants observed in primary and metastatic {CRC} cell populations are consistent with relatively old populations, suggesting that clonal evolution leading to selective sweeps may be rare after transformation. Selection in human cancers appears to be a weaker than presumed force after transformation, consistent with the observed rarity of driver mutations in cancer genomes. Phenotypic plasticity rather than the stepwise acquisition of new driver mutations may better account for the many different phenotypes within human tumors.},

	doi = {10.2202/1544-6115.1374},
	abstract = {Little is known about how human cancers grow because direct observations are impractical. Cancers are clonal populations and the billions of cancer cells present in a visible tumor are progeny of a single transformed cell. Therefore, human cancers can be represented by somatic cell ancestral trees that start from a single transformed cell and end with billions of present day cancer cells. We use a genealogical approach to infer tumor growth from somatic trees, employing haplotype {DNA} methylation pattern variation, or differences between specific {CpG} sites or "tags," in the cancer genome. {DNA} methylation is an epigenetic mark that is copied, with error, during genome replication. At our tags, neutral copy errors in {DNA} methylation appear to occur at random, and much more frequently than sequence copy errors. To reconstruct a cancer tree, we sample and compare human colorectal genomes within small geographic regions (a cancer fragment), between fragments on the same side of the tumor, and between fragments from opposite tumor halves. The combined information on both physical distance and epigenetic distance informs our model for tumor ancestry. We use approximate Bayesian computation, a simulation-based method, to model tumor growth under a variety of evolutionary scenarios, estimating parameters that fit observed {DNA} methylation patterns. We conclude that methylation patterns sampled from human cancers are consistent with replication errors and certain simple cancer growth models. The inferred cancer trees are consistent with Gompertzian growth, a well-known cancer growth pattern.},

For this, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree of these species, estimated {GS} and {FD} of them, inferred the tempo and mode of evolution of these traits and their correlations, using both current and phylogenetically independent contrasted values. We found significant correlations among the traits, when considering the complete set of data or only the subgenus Passiflora, whereas no correlations were observed within Decaloba. Herein, we present convincing evidence of adaptive evolution of {GS}, as well as clues that this pattern is limited by a minimum genome size, which could reduce both the possibilities of changes in {GS} and the possibility of phenotypic responses to environment changes.},

However, recent evolutionary reconstructions challenge this notion. Two notable examples are the reconstruction of the complex archaeal ancestor and the intron-rich ancestor of eukaryotes. In both cases, evolution in most of the lineages was apparently dominated by extensive loss of genes and introns, respectively. These and many other cases of reductive evolution are consistent with a general model composed of two distinct evolutionary phases: the short, explosive, innovation phase that leads to an abrupt increase in genome complexity, followed by a much longer reductive phase, which encompasses either a neutral ratchet of genetic material loss or adaptive genome streamlining. Quantitatively, the evolution of genomes appears to be dominated by reduction and simplification, punctuated by episodes of complexification.},

Sampling a single cell uniformly from the population at a time \$\$T {\textgreater} 0\$\$and looking along the sampled cell’s ancestral lineage, we find that the reproduction law is heterogeneous—the expected reproductive output of ancestral cells on the lineage from time 0 to time T continuously increases with time. This ‘inspection paradox’ is due to sampling bias, that cells with a larger number of offspring are more likely to have one of their descendants sampled by virtue of their prolificity. The bias’s strength changes with the random population size and/or the sampling time T. Our main result explicitly characterises the evolution of reproduction rates and sizes along the sampled ancestral lineage as a mixture of Poisson processes, which simplifies in special cases. The ancestral bias helps to explain recently observed variation in mutation rates along lineages of the developing human embryo.},

	abstract = {A deterministic formula is commonly used to approximate the expected generation number of a population of growing cells. However, this can give misleading results because it does not allow for natural variation in the times that individual cells take to reproduce. Here we present more accurate approximations for both symmetric and asymmetric cell division. Based on the first two moments of the generation time distribution, these approximations are also robust. We illustrate the improved approximations using data that arise from monitoring individual yeast cells under a microscope and also demonstrate how the approximations can be used when such detailed data are not available.},

It is shown that in the supercritical case the distribution \{Rn(t); n = 0,1,...\} has asymptotically, for large t, a (non-random) normal form, and that the mean Σ {nRn}(t) is asymptotically linear in t. Further, it is found that, for large n, Rn(t) has the shape of a normal density function (of t). Two other random functions are also considered: (a) the proportion of the nth generation which is alive at time t, and (b) the proportion of the nth generation which has been born by time t. These functions are also found to have asymptotically a normal form, but with parameters different from those relevant for \{Rn(t)\}. For the critical and subcritical processes, analogous results hold with the random variables replaced by their expectations.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models ({ABMs}) are readily used to capture the stochasticity in tumour evolution; however, these models are often challenging to validate with experimental measurements due to model complexity. The Voronoi cell-based model ({VCBM}) is an off-lattice agent-based model that captures individual cell shapes using a Voronoi tessellation and mimics the evolution of cancer cell proliferation and movement. Evidence suggests tumours can exhibit biphasic growth in vivo. To account for this phenomena, we extend the {VCBM} to capture the existence of two distinct growth phases. Prior work primarily focused on point estimation for the parameters without consideration of estimating uncertainty. In this paper, approximate Bayesian computation is employed to calibrate the model to in vivo measurements of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Our approach involves estimating the distribution of parameters that govern cancer cell proliferation and recovering outputs that match the experimental data. Our results show that the {VCBM}, and its biphasic extension, provides insight into tumour growth and quantifies uncertainty in the switching time between the two phases of the biphasic growth model. We find this approach enables precise estimates for the time taken for a daughter cell to become a mature cell. This allows us to propose future refinements to the model to improve accuracy, whilst also making conclusions about the differences in cancer cell characteristics.},

We develop several parametric specifications based on a cure rate structure, and present the results of the analysis of data collected as part of a motivating study from Milan. Participants in the study were part of a regional breast cancer screening program, and their ten-year trajectories were obtained from administrative data available from the Italian national health care system. We first present a tractable model for which we develop the likelihood contributions of the observed trajectories and perform maximum likelihood inference on the latent process. Likelihood based inference is not feasible for more flexible models, and we implement approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}) for inference. Issues that arise from the use of {ABC} for model choice and parameter estimation are discussed, including the problem of choosing appropriate summary statistics. The estimated parameters of the underlying disease process allow for the study of the effect of different examination schedules (age range and frequency of screening examinations) on a population of asymptomatic subjects.},
