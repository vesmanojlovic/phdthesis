\chapter{Title of the First Appendix}

Two possibilities for the appendices are presented in this template. The Appendix~A is included in the main matter of the thesis after the \textit{\textbackslash\hspace{-0.5mm}appendix} command. This produces that the appendix input in the table of contents is labelled with the corresponding capital letter (in this case 'A'). The text 'Appendix~A' will appear on top of the first page of the appendix, above the appendix's title, in case you have given a title to it.
